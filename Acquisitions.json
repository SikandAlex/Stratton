    "Title": "Air France-KLM wins aid deal, flags likely share issue",
    "Content": "PARIS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Air France-KLM (AIR.PA) secured 7 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in French government aid on Friday, as the airline industry struggles to survive the coronavirus crisis that has all but halted passenger traffic across much of the world. French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire prepares to give a television interview at the Bercy Finance Ministry, during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Paris, France, April 24, 2020. REUTERS/Benoit TessierFrance will issue 3 billion euros in loans as well as 90% guarantees on another 4 billion in bank lending to Air France, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said. The Dutch government said it was preparing a further 2-4 billion euros in aid to KLM. In a video message to staff, Chief Executive Ben Smith said the aid was “not a blank cheque” and would require tough action on costs and performance. Other major airlines including Germany’s Lufthansa LGAG.DE are negotiating government aid deals as they grapple with the air travel shutdown and deep uncertainty over the recovery outlook once the pandemic eases.     Le Maire, speaking on TF1 television, said the support came with unspecified conditions requiring Air France-KLM to “become the most environmentally friendly airline on the planet”. France is also preparing to back about 5 billion euros in loans to carmaker Renault (RENA.PA), he said. Amid tensions between the French and Dutch governments, which each hold close to 14% of Air France-KLM, the company said Paris was likely to increase its investment over the coming year - raising the spectre of nationalisation. The board will discuss a capital increase by next year’s shareholder meeting “at the latest”, Air France-KLM said, adding that France had already “indicated its intention to examine the conditions under which it might participate.” Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra gave a briefing within an hour of his French counterpart’s to announce the KLM aid still awaiting approval, and said there would be a “conversation” among shareholders on a future capital increase. “We have repeatedly said that as the government we will do all that we can to help KLM through this crisis,” Hoekstra said, citing its “vital role” in the Dutch economy. The French state-guaranteed funding comes in the form of 4 billion euros in loans from a syndicate of six banks with a 12-month maturity, and a four-year, 3 billion-euro direct state loan. Both facilities can be extended twice by one year and are subject to EU approval. On Thursday, group CEO Smith gave up his 2020 bonus under public pressure from Hoekstra, who said it was “incompatible with support funded by taxpayers’ money”. “This financing will give us the opportunity to rebuild,” Smith said in his message to staff following the announcements. “Faced with the upheaval the world is going through, we are going to have to rethink our model immediately.” Smith, who joined Air France-KLM from Air Canada in 2018, is poised to accelerate restructuring of the Air France short-haul network and expansion of low-cost division Transavia, La Tribune newspaper has reported, leading to possible job cuts in France.

    "Title": "Doubts gather over Boeing-Embraer deal as deadline nears: sources",
    "Content": "PARIS/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A $4.2 billion deal for Boeing (BA.N) to buy the civil jetmaking arm of Brazil’s Embraer (EMBR3.SA) has hit a roadblock over implementation, threatening its collapse barring a last-minute breakthrough on Friday, people familiar with the talks said. FILE PHOTO: An Embraer E195-2 is seen on display, sporting a livery combining a lion's head with an integrated circuit design, during the 53rd International Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, France, June 17 2019. REUTERS/Pascal RossignolThe companies have been in discussions to assess whether various contractual conditions have been met for the tie-up, including the way a new venture 80%-owned by Boeing would be set up and funded, and have the rest of Friday to resolve the issue. The deal also depends on delayed approval from the European Union which has said it needs until August to complete its anti-trust probe after the deal was cleared by other regulators, but this is not seen as the main stumbling block. Neither company agreed to comment. Under a provisional agreement signed early last year, Boeing (BA.N) and Embraer (EMBR3.SA) had until April 24 - or 15 months after the initial signing - to complete the deal and implement a number of covenants and conditions on both sides. People familiar with the matter stressed that the deadline expires at midnight Sao Paulo time and that a deal could still be reached to resolve outstanding differences, though two sources said the talks were not progressing quickly. Embraer said this week it was in talks with Boeing to extend the April 24 deadline for closing the deal and that there were no assurances about whether or when it would close. At stake is a key plank of Boeing’s strategy for expanding its engineering and industrial base as it faces domestic talks over federal support for the U.S. aerospace industry. Shares in Embraer fell 11% in line with a sell-off on the Brazil market .BVSP after the justice minister resigned accusing President Jair Bolsonaro of interference. Shares in Boeing were down 5.9%. Reuters reported last month that weak markets had raised urgent questions over the fate of the deal as aviation reels from the coronavirus crisis. A drop in Embraer shares and cash concerns at Boeing, driven by the impact of the epidemic on air travel, have undermined the deal’s economics. One source familiar with the talks said Boeing remained committed to the deal and that it would be complex to reverse the carve-out of Embraer’s commercial arm, which makes the E2 series of regional jets competing with the Airbus (AIR.PA) A220. Analysts have not ruled out a second attempt to complete the strategic tie-up if the deal collapses, with Embraer looking increasingly isolated after Airbus bought its main Canadian rival and Boeing seeking a broader and cheaper engineering base. The agreement has a termination fee of $75 million, rising to $100 million if it is for anti-trust reasons, according to a copy of the merger agreement filed to U.S. authorities.

REUTERS/Gonzalo FuentesZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (NESN.S) expects a “more vigorous” year for acquisitions in 2020 as the packaged food giant looks to expand its business, Chief Executive Mark Schneider said on Friday.

    "Title": "Virgin Australia seeks aircraft waivers, owes $4.4 billion: administrator",
    "Content": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd (VAH.AX) owes A$6.9 billion  ($4.39 billion) to more than 10,000 creditors based on an initial review and will seek a three-month payment waiver from aircraft lessors, its administrators said. FILE PHOTO: A Virgin Australia Airlines plane takes off from Kingsford Smith International Airport in Sydney, Australia, March 18, 2020.  REUTERS/Loren ElliottVirgin said this week it succumbed to third-party led restructuring that could lead to a sale, turning Australia’s second-biggest airline into the Asia-Pacific’s biggest victim of the coronavirus crisis. The figure owed to creditors includes about A$2.3 billion of secured debt, A$2 billion of unsecured bonds, A$1.9 billion of aircraft leases, A$450 million owed to employees, A$167 million to trade creditors and A$71 million to landlords, according to an affidavit from administrator Vaughan Strawbridge. The bankrupt airline’s administrators are liable to pay leases on its aircraft starting April 28, because they will not inform lessors whether they would renege on leases within five business days, as required by law, the documents, posted on the website of Strawbridge’s firm Deloitte, showed. The Deloitte administrators are seeking court orders for an extension of up to four weeks from their appointment to decide if leased planes were required for continuing operations of the business, they said in a letter to lessors on the website. “Next week we will be wanting to engage with you to firm up on interim arrangements with the administrators to support the process being followed to achieve a recapitalisation and sale, which will include a request for a three-month waiver of rent and other financial payment obligations,” they said. A document released by the Federal Court of Australia showed law firm King \u0026 Woods Malleson (KWM) said it was representing 17 aircraft lessors and financiers. These include Aercap Holdings NV (AER.N), Bank of China Ltd (601988.SS), SMBC Aviation Capital, ORIX Aviation, GECAS, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA). The lessors with the biggest financial exposure to Virgin include Goshawk, Avation PLC (AVAP.L), Aercap, ORIX and SMBC, each with estimated monthly income of at least $1 million from the airline, aviation data provider Cirium said.  In a letter on Friday, KWM said its clients wanted to work constructively with the administrators, but required them to pay for regular maintenance and insurance for the planes and report weekly on the use of aircraft. Perth Airport said it had seized a number of Virgin Australia aircraft that had been parked there for some time and were not currently conducting flights to protect the airport’s interests given the airline had “significant outstanding invoices”. “Perth Airport has taken liens over a number of Virgin aircraft - a standard practice in these situations,” a spokeswoman said in a statement. Sydney Airport and Melbourne Airport said they had not seized Virgin aircraft. “We prefer to work constructively with our airline partners through this period,” a Sydney Airport spokesman said. For now, Virgin is flying a skeleton schedule under its regular management team as administrators seek a buyer for the entire operation. Private equity and distressed situation specialists Apollo Global Management, Oaktree Capital Management and BGH Capital are among more than 10 firms to express interest in the restructuring, Reuters has reported, citing five sources.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid(Reuters) - L Brands Inc (LB.N) filed a legal complaint against Sycamore Partners on Thursday, after the buyout firm walked away from a $525 million deal to acquire a majority stake in the company’s Victoria’s Secret lingerie brand. The filing in a Delaware court sets up the first high-profile U.S. legal fight over the termination of a merger agreement because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sycamore said on Wednesday the worldwide closure of nearly all 1,600 Victoria’s Secret and PINK stores, including more than a thousand stores in North America, in response to the coronavirus outbreak occurred without its permission and had breached the terms of the deal. However, L Brands said the agreement was still valid as it was transparent with Sycamore on the steps it was taking to “protect the Victoria’s Secret business”.  The company said Sycamore tried to renegotiate the purchase price of the 55% stake, before sending a termination notice. Sycamore Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.

    "Title": "Key U.S. lawmaker pushes for a ban on mergers until coronavirus pandemic ends",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, speaks during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S. December 12, 2019. Alex Edelman/Pool via REUTERSWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chair of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel on Thursday called for a moratorium on mergers in the next coronavirus stimulus package and a ban on deals that are not directly related to companies about to fail. Democratic U.S. Representative David Cicilline’s proposal attempts to ensure that large companies do not wipe out competition from smaller rivals already hit hard by the pandemic. Mega-mergers and corporate takeovers that were permitted during the last economic crisis led to the firing of millions of workers, the slowing of investment and innovation, and huge increases in executive compensation, Cicilline said during an  event hosted by the Open Markets Institute, a Washington-based antitrust advocacy group. “We must take immediate action to halt this trend by including a moratorium in the upcoming stimulus package on all transactions that do not involve firms that are truly failing or in bankruptcy,” Cicilline said. He said there can be room left “for merger activity that is necessary to ensuring that distressed firms have a fresh start through the bankruptcy process or through necessary divestitures while also ensuring that we do not undergo another period of rampant and unhealthy consolidation.” Cicilline’s comments come at a time when his committee is conducting an antitrust probe into tech giants including Amazon (AMZN.O) , Facebook (FB.O), Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Apple (AAPL.O). That probe was set to end in March but has been delayed by the pandemic. Any attempts to put changes like this in future stimulus bills would likely face fierce opposition from Wall Street banks, which earn big fees from merger and acquisition activity and the business lobbying groups which see mergers as a way to build businesses quickly.

    "Title": "Sycamore Partners backs out of coronavirus-stricken deal for Victoria's Secret",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Buyout firm Sycamore Partners disclosed on Wednesday it had walked away from a $525 million deal to acquire a majority stake in Victoria’s Secret, after the lingerie brand shut down stores and furloughed staff in response to the coronavirus outbreak. FILE PHOTO: A woman views a Christmas seasonal display at a Victoria's Secret lingerie flagship store in London, Britain, December 6, 2018.  REUTERS/Toby MelvilleVictoria’s Secret owner L Brands Inc (LB.N) vowed to challenge the move, setting up the first high-profile U.S. legal fight over the termination of a merger agreement because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has shut down large swaths of the economy.  In a Delaware court filing, Sycamore said that L Brands had breached the terms of the deal, signed on Feb. 20, by closing nearly all of its about 1,600 Victoria’s Secret and PINK stores globally, including more than a thousand stores in North America, without Sycamore’s permission. L Brands also furloughed most of its Victoria’s Secret employees and reduced compensation for senior staff and took other actions that could hurt the lingerie business, such as not paying rent or taking receipt of new merchandise, Sycamore said in the filing.  “That these actions were taken as a result of or in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is no defense to L Brands’ clear breaches of the transaction agreement,” Sycamore said in its complaint. L Brands said that Sycamore’s termination of the transaction agreement was invalid and that it would pursue all legal remedies to enforce its contractual rights, including the right of “specific performance” for a judge to force completion of the deal. L Brands shares dropped 15.5% Wednesday to $13.78. While Victoria’s Secret, known for its crystal encrusted bras and voluptuous models, is one of the most high-profile deals to result in litigation since the coronavirus outbreak, it is not the only one that has been affected. Last month, U.S. auto parts company BorgWarner Inc (BWA.N) threatened to walk away from a $951 million deal to buy Delphi Technologies (DLPH.N), after the automotive equipment supplier drew down a credit line without its acquirer’s approval. BorgWarner said the move breached their deal terms and gave Delphi 30 days to “cure” the issue. A special committee for co-working company WeWork earlier this month sued its investor, SoftBank Group (9984.T) for ditching a $3 billion tender offer, accusing it of buyer’s remorse.Retailer Bed, Bath \u0026 Beyond Inc BBY.O this month also asked a judge to hold 1-800-Flowers.com Inc (FLWS.O) accountable for a $252 million deal. Merger agreements routinely include contractual provisions to protect the parties involved, citing earthquakes, pandemics and ‘acts of God’ as possible ways out of a deal. While L Brands’ deal with Sycamore has a carve-out to prevent the acquirer from citing a pandemic’s impact on Victoria Secret’s business as grounds to walk away, the private equity firm argued in its filing that this did not cover the breach that had transpired. “L Brands will no doubt counter, ‘Are you serious, we should have defied the government’s order to keep our stores open?’ But Sycamore still has a potential claim, notwithstanding the public relations hit they’re going to take,” Columbia Law School professor Eric Talley said in an interview after reviewing Sycamore’s complaint. While Sycamore said in its complaint that L Brands rejected its request to renegotiate the deal price, Talley said it was possible that the companies could settle and restructure the deal. Under its agreement with Sycamore, L Brands would keep a 45% stake in Victoria’s Secret. The divestment would allow L Brands to focus on its better-performing Bath \u0026 Body Works brand, a seller of soaps and lotions, located mostly in malls across the United States.

    "Content": "NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Facebook (FB.O) is set to spend $5.7 billion to buy a 9.99% stake in Reliance Industries’ (RELI.NS) digital arm, as it looks to roll out services for India’s grocers and small businesses by capitalizing on WhatsApp’s extensive reach in the country. The deal announced on Wednesday is Facebook’s biggest since its $22 billion buyout of WhatsApp in 2014 and will give the Menlo Park, California-based firm a stake in Jio Platforms - the digital services entity that houses Reliance’s telecoms arm Jio Infocomm, as well as its news, movie and music apps, along with other businesses.  The transaction is also the eighth largest deal in Asia this year based on deal value, according to Refinitiv data, and comes at a time when the coronavirus outbreak has stifled mergers and acquisitions activity globally. To kick off the partnership, Facebook’s WhatsApp messenger, which counts India as its biggest market with about 400 million users, will help fuel the growth of Jio’s new retail venture, JioMart, the two companies said. “In the near future JioMart ... and WhatsApp will empower nearly 30 million small Indian kirana (grocery) shops to digitally transact with every customer in their neighborhood,” Mukesh Ambani, Reliance chairman and Asia’s richest man, said in a video statement. JioMart, the e-commerce venture of Reliance’s retail arm, offers customers free express grocery deliveries from neighborhood mum-and-pop stores. It is yet to be launched across India, and is likely to pose a formidable challenge to Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) local unit and Walmart’s (WMT.N) Flipkart, which are also betting big on groceries to grow. For Reliance, the deal will help the oil-to-retail group,  which bet over $30 billion on the Jio telecoms venture, reduce its debt load.  FACEBOOK INDIA ROADMAP The companies said the potential benefits of the deal were manifold, but shied away from giving details. “We will really look to explore multiple areas of collaboration,” Ajit Mohan, the India head of Facebook, told journalists on a call. “And the spirit of it will be - can we open new doors? Can we open new avenues?”  FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Facebook logo is placed between small toy people figures in front of a keyboard in this illustration taken April 12, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationThe investment, according to tech and retail analysts, will give Facebook new means to expand in India, its biggest market outside of the United States. Facebook’s offerings such as WhatsApp Business, which allows businesses to catalog products and send automated replies, and a payment service, could be handy tools for millions of small retailers and customers that Reliance wants to tie together. The alliance with Jio, which has over 380 million subscribers, could also help WhatsApp evolve into an Indian version of Chinese internet giant Tencent’s (0700.HK) WeChat, which allows users to chat, make payments and book flights and hotels, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said. “The idea is to turn the Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram ecosystem into something like that. What Facebook don’t want to do is go out and deal with the physical task of building warehouses, keeping inventory. They don’t want to be a Walmart or an Amazon,” the source added, declining to be identified as details of the deal were private. RELIANCE’S SWAY The perceived closeness between Reliance chairman Ambani - who has net worth of $49.2 billion, according to Forbes - and India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party could also ease Facebook’s struggles in country which has taken Big Tech to task over issues such as misinformation and data privacy, sources said. WhatsApp’s payments service has been awaiting regulatory clearances for nearly two years, and India has previously blamed WhatsApp for the spread of misinformation and fake news. Facebook’s Mohan, however, played down the idea of the deal being aimed at smoothing regulatory issues, saying it was squarely focused on meeting the needs of small business owners. Reliance has always pitched Jio as a technology company and it is using its financial muscle to build smart homes, which could rival Amazon’s Alexa-based solutions, connected cars and security systems. For all of those, it could potentially tap into Facebook’s tech prowess.   “They (Reliance) have great ambition. As they try to build a retail business on top of the core Jio base, this deal provides them with a mechanism for not having to go through a hit and trial method, but leverage some technologies that are proven,” said Atul Kunwar, a former Chief Technology officer at one of India’s biggest IT firms, Tech Mahindra (TEML.NS).

REUTERS/Shailesh AndradeShares in Reliance ended 10% higher after rising as much as 12% earlier on the news, contributing nearly half the gains on the NSE Nifty 50 index on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley acted as financial adviser for Reliance, while AZB \u0026 Partners and Davis Polk \u0026 Wardwell acted as legal counsel. Facebook was advised by Bank of America.

REUTERS/Paulo WhitakerBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have resumed their investigation into Boeing’s (BA.N) bid to buy the jetmaking arm of Embraer (EMBR3.SA), with a decision due by Aug. 7, a European Commission filing showed on Wednesday. The EU executive halted its probe on Feb. 24 while waiting for the companies to provide information it had requested. The so-called stop the clock ended on April 7, according to the filing. Sources said millions of documents have been provided in recent months. The EU competition enforcer in October last year expressed concerns about the $4.2 billion deal, saying it would remove Embraer as the third largest global competitor in the highly concentrated commercial aircraft industry, especially in single-aisle commercial planes.  Embraer’s commercial unit builds jetliners in the 70- to 150-seat segment and competes with the Canadian-designed A220 programme recently acquired by Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA).  Brazil’s competition watchdog has already approved the deal, which has garnered backing from some of the world’s largest aircraft buyers.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch(Reuters) - Online travel services company Expedia Group Inc (EXPE.O) is in advanced talks to sell a stake to private-equity firms Silver Lake Partners and Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) for about $1 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Expedia’s shares rose more than 6% in extended trading. The company’s shares have fallen about 47% so far this year as global travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic ground the travel and tourism industry to a virtual halt. The company is expected to give board representation to the investors as part of the deal, which could be announced this week, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  However, the talks could still collapse and Expedia could opt to raise funds in a public-debt offering instead, the report added.

    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange said on Tuesday it was committed to completing its $27 billion takeover of data company Refinitiv in the second half of the year, with no plans to revise its savings targets for the deal as a deep recession beckons. FILE PHOTO: Signage is seen outside the entrance of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain. Aug 23, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo“We still have a lot of confidence in the transaction, in the strategic rationale of the transaction,” LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer told analysts. The coronavirus pandemic is sending economies rapidly into deep recession, forcing many companies to furlough millions of staff and raise funds to stay afloat. Analysts asked Schwimmer whether the deteriorating economy was changing his view of the Refinitiv deal and he said it was “a little bit early to be speculating” on synergies from the deal. The recurring nature of Refinitiv’s income was an “attractive element” that offers resilience during such economic conditions, Schwimmer said. “I don’t think that at this point we have any plans to change anything in terms of our target synergies,” Schwimmer said. “We think the combined business would be able to continue to perform well through an environment like this and would be able to handle the leverage.” Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters, which owns Reuters News.  COMPETITION SCRUTINY European Union competition regulators had requested a delay on all filings from merger parties due to its staff having to work from home during the coronavirus pandemic. “We continue to engage constructively with the case team at the European Commission. They have been in communication with us and we continue to answer questions. We are continuing to make progress,” Schwimmer said. Schwimmer said he was still committed to completing the deal in the second half of this year. LSE Chief Financial Officer David Warren said the “bridge” put together with banks to finance the deal could be extended until 2021 if need be and contained “significant headroom”. There is a “drop dead” May 2021 deadline for the transaction that can be extended by mutual agreement of both parties. The LSE said it was too early to say what the impact of the pandemic would be on its own operations but that it has over 1 billion pounds in free cash and cash lines to maintain continuity of business. “Our business continues to generate cash and bring our own leverage down,” Schwimmer said. The LSE intends to pay its final dividend for the 2019 financial year, subject to approval from shareholders at the annual meeting later on Tuesday morning, it said. The exchange posted first quarter results on Tuesday that were lifted by higher trading and clearing volumes during recent bouts of extreme market volatility. First quarter total income rose 13% year-on-year to 615 million pounds ($763.2 million) as the exchange benefited from higher trading in shares, and higher clearing activity. Related CoverageLSE says no plans to revisit savings target from Refinitiv dealMarkets across the world faced bouts of extreme volatility and record volumes during March as investors priced in recessions following national lockdowns that have shut down swathes of economic activity.   “There will be lots of consideration about how the ecosystem worked in the period of heightened volatility. I am not clear that we are through the worst of this yet,” Schwimmer said. “We can say with confidence that so far our systems have worked very well,” Schwimmer said.

    "Content": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler and Volvo Trucks have agreed to join forces to develop, produce and sell fuel cell systems for heavy-duty vehicles, in a sign that the coronavirus crisis is accelerating consolidation. FILE PHOTO: Daimler AG sign is pictured at the IAA truck show in Hanover, Germany, September 22, 2016.  REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File PhotoGlobal car and truck makers are exploring ways to share costs on new technologies as customers shun showrooms in areas hit by the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, denting profits. “The common goal is for both companies to offer heavy-duty vehicles with fuel cells for demanding long-haul applications in series production in the second half of the decade,” Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volvo (VOLVb.ST) said on Tuesday. The joint venture agreed by the two companies will operate as an independent and autonomous entity, with Daimler Truck AG and the Volvo Group continuing to be competitors in all other areas of business, they said in a joint statement. “Joining forces will decrease development costs for both companies and accelerate the market introduction of fuel cell systems in products used for heavy-duty transport and demanding long-haul applications,” the companies said. Volvo will acquire 50% in the joint venture for around 0.6 billion euros, they added. Both companies will invest a nine-digit amount each into developing the fuel cell system. “We want to establish a company that serves not just the sharehoders but the entire industry,” Daimler Trucks CEO Martin Daum said in a call to discuss the deal. Upon being asked whether the corona pandemic had forced the two truck makers to explore the alliance, Volvo chief executive Martin Lundstedt said, “The coronavirus convinced us even more.”  Auto supplier Robert Bosch earlier this year announced plans to start mass production of fuel cells starting in 2022 and Hyundai has started rolling out a fleet of fuel cell strucks in Europe this year. Daimler and Volvo’s fuel cell alliance is open to other members joining, Daum and Lundstedt said on call to discuss the alliance.  Daimler Trucks will bring together all of Daimler’s fuel cell activities in a new fuel cell unit, including those of Mercedes-Benz Fuel Cell GmbH. Automotive and non-automotive usage are also part of the new joint venture’s scope. The preliminary agreement between the two companies is non-binding, with a final deal expected by the third quarter and closing before the end of 2020, the companies said.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A Volkswagen Beetle is reflected in the chrome of a wheel during the media day at the Canadian International AutoShow in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, February 14, 2019. REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File PhotoHAMBURG (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has reached settlements with 200,000 of the 260,000 claimants participating in a class action lawsuit brought by German consumer group VZBV over the carmaker’s rigging of diesel emissions tests, the carmaker said on Monday.  A further 21,000 cases were still being reviewed for possible payouts of 1,350 - 6,250 euros ($1,464.35 - $6,779.38) per car and the deadline for participating in the settlement has been extended to April 30, VW added. The exact amount depends on the age and model of the owner’s car. Volkswagen will pay out a total of 620 million euros. It had set aside 830 million to cover the costs of settlements with all participants of in the VZBV class action.  The deal marks a further step in the German carmaker’s efforts to make amends after it admitted in 2015 to using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests.  The effort has cost Volkswagen more than $30 billion in vehicle refits, fines and provisions. Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States, but VW has said there was no legal basis for consumers in Germany to seek compensation due to differences in law.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Neiman Marcus to file for bankruptcy as soon as this week - sources",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Neiman Marcus Group is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection as soon as this week, becoming the first major U.S. department store operator to succumb to the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, people familiar with the matter said. The debt-laden Dallas-based company has been left with few options after the pandemic forced it to temporarily shut all 43 of its Neiman Marcus locations, roughly two dozen Last Call stores and its two Bergdorf Goodman stores in New York.  Neiman Marcus is in the final stages of negotiating a loan with its creditors totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, which would sustain some of its operations during bankruptcy proceedings, according to the sources. It has also furloughed many of its roughly 14,000 employees.  The bankruptcy filing could come within days, though the timing could slip, the sources said. Neiman Marcus skipped  millions of dollars in debt payments last week, including one that only gave the company a few days to avoid a default. Neiman Marcus’ borrowings total about $4.8 billion, according to credit ratings firm Standard \u0026 Poor’s. Some of this debt is the legacy of its $6 billion leveraged buyout in 2013 by its owners, private equity firm Ares Management Corp and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). The sources requested anonymity because the bankruptcy preparations are confidential. Neiman Marcus and Ares declined to comment, while CPPIB representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Other department store operators that have also had to close their stores are battling to avoid Neiman Marcus’ fate. Macy’s Inc and Nordstrom Inc have been rushing to secure new financing, such as by borrowing against some of their real estate. J.C. Penney Co Inc is contemplating a bankruptcy filing as a way to rework its unsustainable finances and save money on looming debt payments, Reuters reported last week. A bankruptcy filing would be a grim milestone that Neiman Marcus has spent the last few years trying to avoid. It pushed out due dates on its financial obligations last year in a restructuring deal with some creditors, though the transactions added to Neiman Marcus’ interest expenses.  The signage outside the Neiman Marcus store is seen during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in New York City, U.S., April 19, 2020. REUTERS/Jeenah MoonA trustee for some of the company’s bondholders sued Neiman Marcus last year, claiming the firm and its owners robbed investors of the value of its luxury e-commerce site MyTheresa by moving the business beyond the reach of creditors in a corporate reshuffling. Neiman maintains its actions were proper.  “In light of the significant headwinds stemming from the coronavirus pandemic and our expectation for a U.S. recession this year, we believe the company’s prospects for a turnaround are increasingly low,” Standard \u0026 Poor’s analysts wrote in a note last week. “We continue to view its capital structure as unsustainable,” the analysts added, lowering their credit rating on Neiman Marcus deep into “junk” territory. They said the move reflected the “elevated potential” of a debt restructuring. Once it files for bankruptcy, Neiman Marcus could attract interest from potential suitors seeking to pick up the company or some of its assets on the cheap, the sources said.  Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co explored a bid for Neiman Marcus in 2017 but did not pursue it, people familiar with the matter said at the time. The Canadian company was taken private earlier this year by a group of shareholders led by its chief executive Richard Baker, and it is unclear if it remains interested or would be in a position to pursue a new bid.  A Hudson’s Bay representative did not immediately return a request for comment. FROM FASHION FIXTURE TO BRINK OF BANKRUPTCY The first Neiman Marcus store opened in Dallas, Texas, in 1907. It was opened by the Marcus and Neiman families, which decided to pursue the retail venture after considering and rejecting an investment in a little-known soft drink at the time called Coca-Cola, according to Neiman Marcus’ website. The signages outside the Neiman Marcus store are seen during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in New York City, U.S., April 19, 2020. REUTERS/Jeenah MoonThe company expanded across the United States and in 1972 it acquired New York City’s Bergdorf Goodman, itself founded in the early 1900s, becoming a fashion fixture for celebrities and wealthy customers seeking expensive handbags and clothing. Like other brick-and-mortar department store operators, Neiman Marcus struggled in recent years to compete with discount retail chains and a consumer shift to online shopping. Luxury e-commerce firms such as Yoox Net-A-Porter Group (YNAP) and Farfetch Ltd have added to the competitive pressure facing Neiman Marcus. The coronavirus outbreak has pushed the company to the brink. While it has asked some workers back to closed stores to fulfill online orders, these operations cannot make up for lost sales in physical stores.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip(Reuters) - Standard Chartered (STAN.L) said on Monday it had agreed with Indonesian conglomerate PT Astra International (ASII.JK) to sell their stake in Indonesia’s PT Bank Permata (BNLI.JK) to lender Bangkok Bank PCL (BBL.BK) at a reduced price. The three companies agreed to a purchase price that values Permata at 1.63 times its book value as of March 31, down from the earlier agreed multiple of 1.77 times, conditional upon the deal closing before June 30. Asia-focused lender StanChart said it now expects its unit, which owned Permata stake, to receive a consideration of about $1.06 billion, down from the $1.3 billion estimated in December, citing the revised valuation, reduction in Permata’s equity and depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah.  In December, Thailand-based Bangkok Bank agreed to buy an 89.1% stake in Indonesia’s Bank Permata for about $2.7 billion, in the first major overseas acquisition for a Thai bank. StanChart and Astra International jointly controlled Permata, each owning 44.56% in the bank that operates about 330 branches across 62 cities in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. Standard Chartered on Monday also said the deal would increase the group’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio by about 40 basis points.

    "Title": "Germany to grant rescue liquidity for carrier Condor: sources",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A banner reding \"Condor we love flying\" is seen next to a check-in counter of airline Condor at the airport  in Frankfurt, Germany, September 24, 2019.  REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachMUNICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany has agreed in principle to support struggling carrier Condor with emergency liquidity after the owner of Poland’s national airline LOT pulled out of a deal to buy the airline, two people close to the matter said on Monday.  Condor is a former unit of Thomas Cook, the holiday company that collapsed in September. With planes unable to fly because of travel restrictions, the airline had grounded its fleet and called for state aid. A 380 million euro ($413.82 million) state bridging loan, that allowed the carrier to be rescued last year, is de facto being extended and Germany will offer an additional 200 million in liquidity, the sources said. Condor said that talks with the government were ongoing, while the Economy Ministry declined to comment.  No decision on a longer-term capital structure of the group has been taken, the sources said, adding that Germany plans to launch a new sales process for the airline after the coronavirus crisis. Earlier this month, sources familiar with the matter said Germany was ready to take over Condor as it expected the deal with LOT to collapse due to the industry turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic. State-run Polish Aviation Group (PGL), which owns LOT, agreed in January to buy Condor for about 300 million euros, potentially creating a leading European aviation group with more than 20 million passengers a year.  But PGL earlier this month pulled out of the deal.

    "Title": "Exclusive: India foreign investment rules aimed at China to include Hong Kong - sources",
    "Content": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - New Indian rules to ensure scrutiny of investments from companies based in neighbouring countries, especially during the coronavirus outbreak, will also apply to Hong Kong, two senior government sources told Reuters on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Students wear masks of China's President Xi Jinping as other waves national flags of India and China, ahead of the informal summit with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at a school in Chennai, India, October 10, 2019. REUTERS/P. RavikumarIndia said on Saturday that foreign direct investments from  countries with which it shares a land border would require prior government approval to deter “opportunistic” takeovers and acquisitions during the pandemic, but it gave few other details. While the move was seen aimed at Chinese firms, it caused confusion among lawyers, investors and business executives on whether it would apply to Hong Kong, a special administrative region in South China that enjoys a measure of autonomy under a “one country, two systems” policy agreed at the time of its 1997 handover from Britain. A substantial part of Chinese investments is routed through the Asian financial centre given its market expertise and deep pool of liquidity. India’s industries ministry, which drafted the policy, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Two Indian government officials told Reuters the policy will be interpreted in a broad manner and will not make any distinction between China and Hong Kong investments, saying inflows from both will be scrutinised in the same manner. “It’s common sense how Hong Kong investment should be taken. Investment from there is no different to China,” said one of the officials. The officials have been involved in the framing of India’s investment policies. Indian government data showed that between April 2000 and December 2019, foreign direct investments from China stood at $2.3 billion and $4.2 billion from Hong Kong. The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi said on Monday the rules were against free and fair trade and “Chinese investment has driven the development of India’s industries”. It said China’s cumulative investment in India exceeds $8 billion. Some experts believe the total investment coming through Chinese entities is far higher as it is routed through multiple jurisdictions.  The new rules govern entities located in a country that shares a land border with India and will be applicable even if the “beneficial owner” of an investment is from those nations. Such investments will require a government approval, the rules said, meaning they can’t go through a so-called automatic route. The rules did not name China or Hong Kong.  India has land borders with China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan.  Three government officials, including the first two, also clarified the new rules of scrutiny would apply to foreign direct investments in greenfield projects. “There is no sunset clause for the rules,” the first government official said about the timeframe of the policy, adding that it would be used “in the widest possible way”. POLICY CONCERNS The new rules are seen slowing down investment timelines and straining Indian startups that get regular funding from major Chinese companies, especially when the coronavirus outbreak has already hit them hard. Indian digital payments firm Paytm, online grocer BigBasket and e-commerce company Snapdeal all have been funded by China’s Alibaba (BABA.N). China’s Bytedance has plans to invest $1 billion in India, while automakers including Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (601633.SS) and MG Motor, a unit of China’s SAIC (600104.SS), have said they intend to invest millions. India took the decision after several local industry groups flagged concerns around Chinese inflows during the spread of coronavirus that had made some Indian businesses more vulnerable to takeovers, a fourth person familiar with the thinking said. FILE PHOTO: A general view of the city of Hong Kong from the Peak Tower, China October 22, 2019. REUTERS/Ammar AwadSeveral ministries, including India’s foreign affairs department, then pitched for changes and studied similar restrictions that had been imposed by countries such as Germany and Australia, the source added.  A lawyer who advises Chinese investors told Reuters on Monday that his clients were concerned by the rules and there was a plan this week to seek clarifications on the policy.  “A lot of companies who had finalised their investments are shocked; this injects a lot of uncertainty,” said the lawyer.

    "Title": "Occidental shareholders get first say on Anadarko deal with vote on Berkshire financing",
    "Content": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum shareholders next month will get their first say on the oil company’s troubled acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum when they vote on issuing shares and warrants to Berkshire Hathaway for helping finance the $38 billion deal. FILE PHOTO: The logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe Anadarko acquisition closed in August, months before an oil price crash sapped the cash flow Occidental needed to pay the debt taken with the purchase. Critics, including activist shareholder Carl Icahn, have said the financing deal with Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett was too generous.      Occidental and Berkshire Hathaway declined to comment. Berkshire Hathaway’s $10 billion investment provided it with warrants for 80 million common shares in addition to an 8% dividend on preferred shares received for its support for the Anadarko Petroleum acquisition.   Shareholders, who did not get to vote on the Anadarko deal last year, will vote at Occidental's May 29 annual meeting to authorize the warrants and to issue 400 million new shares, some of which could pay the Berkshire dividend. tinyurl.com/ybf9dmtq Shareholders could voice disapproval of the Anadarko deal by not voting in favor of the proposals, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. But Occidental needs the high number of authorized shares to pay the preferred dividend and some employee compensation, “as they need to preserve as much cash as possible,” Rowland added. Cash-strapped Occidental recently paid Berkshire its first quarter dividend with about 17.3 million shares, which are trading at a fifth of what they fetched last year. When paid in shares, the dividend increases to nearly 9%.    Berkshire’s warrants are nearly worthless, because their $62.50 strike price is well above Occidental’s $13.63 closing price on Friday. But they give Berkshire more than a decade to exercise the option, and dividends paid in shares could make it a major holder in short order. The Anadarko acquisition was a bet on rising shale oil prices months ahead of the worst price crash in decades. The purchase saddled Occidental with $40 billion in debt and the oil-price crash has cut the value of assets that Occidental picked up in the deal, dashing its hopes of selling them to pay down the debt. U.S. oil prices have fallen below $20 per barrel from $61 at the start of the year. Chief Executive Vicki Hollub’s base pay for 2020 was cut 81%, according to a Friday filing, as the board capped the salaries of named officers at $250,000. Her base salary in 2019 was $1.33 million. Hollub had $4.4 million in realized compensation last year, as the value of stock awards - worth $10.5 million during 2019 - tumbled with the company’s share price. Pay for non-employee board members also was cut 15% recently due to “the sudden and significant decline in global commodity prices,” the filing said.

REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank investor Riebeck-Brauerei on Friday filed a motion seeking a vote to oust the lender’s chairman Paul Achleitner at this year’s annual general meeting, according to a document prepared by the activist shareholder’s lawyer. This is the third consecutive year that the small German investor has sought the chair’s removal and comes as Deutsche Bank is the midst of a major restructuring. The motion, filed by Riebeck lawyer Jan Bayer, criticises the payment of billions of euros in bonuses despite record losses, millions in severance packages for former board members, and a failure to rein in money laundering issues.  “Personnel changes must be made,” said the letter from the lawyer seen by Reuters. Deutsche Bank, which holds its shareholder meeting on May 20, declined to comment. Last year, the bank said its supervisory board had “full confidence” in Achleitner’s performance. In 2019, the Riebeck-Brauerei’s motion garnered 9.75% of the vote, up from 9.05% in 2018. Riebeck-Brauerei has disclosed ownership of 200,000 Deutsche shares. Achleitner’s second five-year term ends in 2022. He is in search of a successor, people with direct knowledge of the matter have said.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Chinese-backed owners commit to British HQ for Imagination Tech",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - The Chinese-backed owners of Imagination Technologies told the British government on Friday the chip designer would remain headquartered in the United Kingdom and they would consult over any board changes. FILE PHOTO: The headquarters of technology company Imagination Technologies is seen on the outskirts of London, Britain, June 22, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKayConfirming an earlier Reuters source-based report, private equity firm Canyon Bridge, which is backed by Chinese state-owned China Reform holdings, said it had a constructive meeting with the British government. British lawmakers recently became concerned that Imagination Technologies, which supplies intellectual property in areas including graphics and video processing to groups like Apple (AAPL.O), could end up being moved out of the United Kingdom.  Canyon Bridge representatives had a conference call with Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden on Friday. “Imagination Technologies and its owners Canyon Bridge had a constructive meeting,” a spokesman for Canyon Bridge and Imagination Technologies said in an emailed statement. “We discussed our ongoing commitment to Imagination Technologies as a UK-headquartered business and have agreed to maintain dialogue with the Secretary of State as we further build out our senior management team,” the spokesman said. A British government source also confirmed the meeting had taken place.  “The government will continue to monitor the situation closely and take the appropriate steps as necessary to make sure it protects UK interests,” the source said.  Once a jewel in Britain’s technological crown, Imagination was bought by Canyon Bridge in 2017. British lawmakers became concerned that the company could end up being moved out of the United Kingdom when Canyon Bridge tried to appoint its board members, though the crucial board meeting earlier this month was cancelled at the request of the government. A source with knowledge of the talks who spoke on condition of anonymity said Canyon committed to the majority of Imagination Technologies’ staff remaining in the United Kingdom and to continue investment in research and development and intellectual property development. “They want to maintain their commitment to the UK economy,” said the source. Spokesmen for the British government declined immediate comment. British lawmaker David Davis told Reuters on Tuesday that the government should seek every mechanism to prevent the removal of the technology base of Imagination Technologies to China, including seeking a Western buyer for the company.  Davis said Imagination was a strategic asset and the government should make it absolutely plain that it does not view the export of such important British technology with equanimity. The sale of Imagination Technologies, founded in 1985, was approved by the government of then-Prime Minister Theresa May on the basis that Canyon Bridge would be subject to U.S. law.  Canyon Bridge was originally incorporated in the United States but has since moved to the Cayman Islands, a spokesman said. The sale of Imagination in 2017 came after its biggest customer Apple said it would develop more of its own graphics technology, sending the British company’s shares down 70%. British government officials met Canyon Bridge during the 2017 takeover talks, and it pledged to invest in Imagination’s research and development capabilities in Britain when the deal was approved in November of that year. Apple continued to use Imagination’s technology, and Imagination announced a new multi-year, multi-use license agreement with the iPhone maker in January.

    "Content": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Lenders UBS (UBSG.S) and HSBC (HSBA.L) have cut their combined stake in AMS (AMS.S) to below 1% from the 15% they were forced to take after weak demand for the sensor maker’s capital increase, a notification to the Swiss stock exchange showed.  FILE PHOTO: The logo of Swiss bank UBS is seen at a branch office in Basel, Switzerland March 2, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannAMS issued 190 million new shares via the rights issue, raising 1.75 billion francs ($1.8 billion) to help fund its purchase of German lighting group Osram (OSRn.DE), with which it wants to form a global leader in sensors and lights.  Because of low take-up, UBS and HSBC, which along with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) are providing a 4.4 billion euro bridge loan for the purchase, were left with an AMS stake of 7.7% and 7.2% respectively. Investors, who have been concerned from the outset that AMS might overstretch itself with the planned takeover, reacted with relief to Friday’s news, boosting AMS shares as much as 11.2% to 10.34 Swiss francs ($10.67).  The European technology index .SX8P was up around 3% at 1245 GMT.  Analysts have said a combination of the two firms could makes sense. AMS is known for its state-of-the-art optical sensors, used for facial recognition in smartphones, and has long been keen on diversifying into applications for the auto industry.  Osram, the world’s leading producer of car headlamps, could open that door. However, AMS’s much smaller size, its dependence on Apple (AAPL.O), the billions of debt it took on to finance the deal, and Osram’s badly performing business have also triggered scepticism towards the tie-up.  The coronavirus pandemic, which has hit many industries, and in particular the car sector, has added to the concerns.  The Swiss stock exchange notification did not say at what price UBS and HSBC had managed to reduce their stake. For the rights issue, AMS demanded 9.20 francs per share.

    "Title": "T-Mobile wins final approval for closed merger with Sprint",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A smartphone with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationWASHINGTON (Reuters) - California’s Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted on Thursday to approve the merger of wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, marking the final approval for a $23 billion deal which closed on April 1. The deal had closed without a final decision from the California PUC, which gave that on Thursday with a unanimous vote. The CPUC had issued a proposed decision in March to approve the merger with conditions. T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to abide by those conditions. The biggest hurdle for the companies was a legal battle with state attorneys general who had argued that the deal would mean higher prices for consumers. But a U.S. federal judge disagreed in February, and allowed the deal, which was originally valued at $26 billion, to go forward. In comments before the vote, two of the commissioners noted the importance of ensuring that conditions that T-Mobile agreed to in order to win the approval be adequately enforced. The combined company now operates under the T-Mobile name and will trade on the NASDAQ as “TMUS.” The deal is designed to enable the combined company to join their high-band and low-band spectrum that could allow a faster roll-out of national 5G. The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission signed off on the merger last year. The department had given its approval to the deal in July on condition the combined wireless company sell off assets to Dish Network, making the latter the fourth-largest provider in the U.S. wireless space.

    "Title": "Coronavirus hurts corporate activism now, but rebound expected",
    "Content": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist shareholders are likely to scale back campaigns in the coming weeks as target companies brace for a deep recession and their favorite calls for change - ranging from mergers to returning cash - are ignored during the coronavirus pandemic. FILE PHOTO: The logo and trading information for Lazard Ltd appear on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 24, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoAt year’s end there may be a rebound when activists ranging from Elliott Management to Third Point to Pershing Square Capital Management have capital to spend and companies need help to perform better, according to data released on Thursday by investment bank Lazard. The year started on a strong note with firms committing billions to push for change at 42 companies in January and February. The pace fell 38% in March from February with only 16 campaigns launched.  As new campaigns nearly ground to a halt in March, the amount of money put to work was the smallest since 2016. “We saw COVID-19’s impact on activism show up in March,” said Jim Rossman, who heads shareholder advisory at Lazard, referring to the respiratory disease caused by the virus. “Lower M\u0026A activity and companies focused on conserving cash will mean that activists are likely to increase their focus on operational performance and how management teams react to the crisis as the basis for new campaigns. But in a few months, activists who have been waiting on the sidelines could come back with a vengeance,” Rossman said in an interview. Activists, who often call on target companies to sell themselves or spin off units, pulled back last month, and of the 16 campaigns launched in March, only five had an M\u0026A component, Lazard said. Similarly companies now worry about conserving cash and 123 U.S. companies ranging from Hilton Worldwide (HLT.N) to Home Depot (HD.N) have suspended or cut back share buyback programs as management braces for the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Such requests would likely fall on deaf ears now for activists used to pressing for buybacks. Only one campaign launched in the first quarter included a request for the return of capital, Lazard said. Many activists are careful to avoid looking overly aggressive during the pandemic, Rossman said, noting they do not want to offend other investors whose help they might need in pushing their case later. Looking ahead, however, Rossman said activists are already looking for businesses that are generally sound but have been battered by the pandemic and need to adjust cost structures and supply chains. “At that point M\u0026A will make a comeback as a theme,” he said.

    "Content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Lagardere (LAGA.PA) gained almost 13% on Thursday after Les Echos reported the French multimedia conglomerate could get help from French tycoon Vincent Bollore and Marc Ladreit de Lacharrière, who heads finance group Fimalac, in its fight with  Amber Capital. FILE PHOTO: The logo of French media group Lagardere is seen at the group's shareholders meeting in Paris, France, May 3, 2018. REUTERS/Charles PlatiauFor more than four years, the activist hedge fund has been criticising the management and stock market performance of Lagardere, which has publishing, travel retail and media businesses. Last month, Amber Capital, which has about 16.4% of Lagardere’s shares, said it would propose its own list of new supervisory board members at Lagardere’s annual shareholder meeting on May 5. “They entered or are considering entering the capital of the publishing and distribution group in order to bring their votes during its May 5 General Meeting,” Les Echos wrote, without citing its sources. These stakes would be smaller than the regulatory threshold of 5%, so they do not have to be notified to French stock market authorities. “It is a friendly gesture of support,” one source close to the matter said, confirming the Les Echos report. Bollore and Lacharriere could not be immediately reached for comment. Lagardere had no official comment. Lagardere shares closed up 12.6% at 17.11 euros. They have rebounded 110% from an historic low of 8.14 euros set on March 17. The shares are still down 11.9% since the start of the year. Amber Capital on Tuesday urged fellow investors to support proposals to replace the majority of Lagardere’s supervisory board members, according to a letter shared with Reuters on Wednesday. It received some backing of proxy advisor ISS, saying in a note “the appointment of five dissident nominees to a 12-member board appears warranted (...) given the apparent need for a robust dissident presence on the board”. Amber has criticised Lagardere’s management and supervisory board for a “denial of reality” over the company’s financial performance. Reporting by Gwenaelle Barzic, Marc Angrand, Dominique Vidalon.

    "Title": "Lazard boosts restructuring team as coronavirus-hit firms run into trouble",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Lazard Ltd has bolstered its senior restructuring team as it seeks to win business from companies struggling to stay afloat in the midst of the economic turbulence caused by the global coronavirus pandemic. FILE PHOTO: The logo and trading information for Lazard Ltd appear on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 24, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid /File PhotoThe U.S. investment bank has created a new London-based role for former Skadden Arps Slate Meagher \u0026 Flom partner, Chris Mallon, to join as a senior adviser to its global restructuring practice. “Chris will be involved on complex restructuring situations as a key part of our global team,” Lazard’s co-head of restructuring for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) David Burlison told Reuters. The International Monetary Fund has predicted the global economy will contract by 3% during 2020, a stunning collapse of activity that has forced companies into negotiations with lenders and governments to seek emergency aid. Independent advisory firms with restructuring capability such as Lazard and Rothschild are in high demand as boardrooms scramble to mitigate the damage of a downturn that has been compared to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Mallon has handled corporate restructurings for more than three decades, holding a senior role at Weil, Gotshal \u0026 Manges LLP as well as Skadden. He worked on the demise of American energy company Enron and also advised the likes of Eurotunnel, operator of the tunnel linking Britain and France, Italian dairy group Parmalat and Danish shipping firm Torm A/S in their debt restructuring efforts. The 63-year-old Briton serves as non-executive director of London-based IT network firm Global Cloud Xchange (GCX) which completed a Chapter 11 financial restructuring in December under Lazard’s advice. In his new post he will support Lazard UK boss Cyrus Kapadia as well as Lazard’s most senior dealmakers around the world. RESTRUCTURING ‘BOON’ The surge in demand for restructuring work has proven a boon for advisory firms that need to offset lost opportunities from a sharp slowdown in mergers and acquisitions (M\u0026A), which dropped 28% in the first quarter of the year and remains in freefall. Lazard, which also advises governments in restructuring their sovereign debt, has seen its corporate pipeline grow significantly since lockdowns were enforced in Europe and the United States, winning mandates for Boeing Co (BA.N) and Macy’s Inc (M.N), among others. “We’re working with a range of companies to help them assess the impact of coronavirus and to think through their business plans and liquidity positions,” Burlison said. Global debt restructuring deals have totalled $26.4 billion since the start of the year, according to Refinitiv data, down 70% from the same period last year. But more business is in the pipeline as most companies are expected to ask their lenders to relax covenants, prompting a new wave of mandates on behalf of creditors in the coming months. The 172-year-old bank has engaged various teams across its global network to woo cash-strapped clients with a range of options, including tapping equity capital markets and enhancing debt-raising capabilities. “It’s not just about restructuring,” Burlison said. “Ultimately companies across sectors want to ensure that they’re doing everything they can to protect their businesses.” Reporting by Pamela Barbaglia; Editing by Sonya HepinstallOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Renault quits its main China venture after weak sales",
    "Content": "PARIS/BEIJING (Reuters) - French automaker Renault SA (RENA.PA) is ditching its main passenger car business in China following poor sales at the loss-making venture with Dongfeng Motor Group (0489.HK).  A slowdown in Chinese automotive sales, which is expected to worsen this year due to the coronavirus crisis, has heaped pressure on carmakers that were already struggling to establish a big presence in China, the world’s biggest vehicle market.  Renault, which entered the Dongfeng joint venture in 2013 and began producing gas-powered cars under the tie-up in Wuhan three years later, is one of the few global carmakers to exit a major project in China in recent years, however.  The carmaker, which will retain a presence in China with other ventures, including in electric vehicles, is trying more broadly to find cost savings and pull out of businesses where it is struggling to make its mark and turn a profit.  This is part of Renault’s efforts to make the most of its alliance with Japanese partner Nissan (7201.T), and the two are due provide a strategy update by mid-May.  Dongfeng had been anticipating Renault’s potential exit from the Chinese joint venture as long as a year ago, a banking source familiar with the matter said. Sales were under pressure long before the coronavirus crisis walloped demand further, another source with knowledge of the situation said.  The venture sold only 18,607 cars in 2019, far below its annual capacity of 110,000 and reported an operating loss of more than 1.5 billion yuan ($212 million). Dongfeng, which will take on Renault’s 50% stake in their venture, plans to revamp and upgrade the business’s existing car plants, which will no longer make Renault-branded cars, a spokeswoman for the Chinese automaker said on Tuesday.  Dongfeng will arrange positions for staff at the venture within its wider group operations, she added. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Renault carmaker is pictured at a dealership in Les Sorinieres, near Nantes, France, February 19, 2020. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File PhotoFinancial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.  ‘NEW CHAPTER’ Renault said it would focus on its light commercial vehicle business with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings (1114.HK). That venture plans to roll out five new models before 2023 and is planning export cars to other markets. Another focus is electric vehicles, which will be built by its venture with Jiangling Motors Corporation Group. Renault and Dongfeng also said they would continue to cooperate on “connected vehicles” and work with common partner Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) on new generation engines. “We are opening a new chapter in China. We will concentrate on electric vehicles and light commercial vehicles, the two main drivers for future clean mobility and more efficiently leverage our relationship with Nissan,” Francois Provost, chairman of the China region for Renault, said in a statement. That could include relying on Nissan dealers rather than Renault ones in the longer term, a source familiar with the matter said.  Renault and Nissan, which both reported losses for 2019 even before the global pandemic hit, are looking to rebalance a relationship strained by the 2018 arrest and subsequent flight of former alliance supremo Carlos Ghosn.  The ex-boss-turned-fugitive, accused of financial misconduct, denies any wrongdoing.  FILE PHOTO: A hostess poses next to Dongfeng Motor Corp A9 sedan at the Auto China 2016 auto show in Beijing, China, April 26, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoOther international carmakers have struggled in China too.     In 2018, Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp (7269.T) sold its stake in a venture with Changan Automobile (000625.SZ). Renault’s French rival PSA (PEUP.PA), meanwhile, is exiting a small joint venture with China’s Chongqing Changan Automobile (000625.SZ) and said in February it had suffered 700 million euros in losses last year in the country.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Saudi Aramco in talks with banks to borrow about $10 billion - sources",
    "Content": "DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, is in early talks with banks for a loan of about $10 billion to help finance its acquisition of a 70% stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC), according to three banking sources. FILE PHOTO: Saudi Aramco logo is pictured at the oil facility in Abqaiq, Saudi Arabia October 12, 2019. REUTERS/Maxim ShemetovAramco 2222.SE agreed last year to buy the controlling stake in SABIC from the kingdom’s wealth fund for $69.1 billion, sealing one of the biggest-ever deals in the global chemical industry. “The financing would be for the SABIC deal, but the borrower is Aramco,” said one of the sources, adding that the discussions were at an initial stage, with the company sounding out banks. “Ten billion dollars is where they want to get to, (it’s) not clear if, in this market, they’ll manage to reach that.” A second source said banks involved in the talks included HSBC (HSBA.L) and JPMorgan (JPM.N), as well as lenders in the Gulf.  In response to a Reuters request for comment about whether it was seeking such a loan, Saudi Aramco said: “The company continues to review its financial options as part of its normal course of business, while prudently preserving its pristine balance sheet and its resilience.” JPMorgan declined to comment, while HSBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  A third banker said Aramco was looking to borrow in U.S. dollars because it was cheaper than in Saudi riyals, in terms of interest, and to avoid pressuring Saudi banks’ liquidity.  OIL PRICES CRASH The SABIC stake acquisition from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will help Aramco’s downstream expansion plans. The deal came after months of talks between the company and PIF and was one of the reasons for the delay of Aramco’s blockbuster initial public offering late last year. The loan discussions come at a time when oil-producing nations have been hit by a plunge in demand for crude as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and a slide in oil prices. OPEC and its allies led by Russia, a group known as OPEC+, have agreed to the largest oil output cut in history that could curb supply by up to 20%. But the agreement has done little to boost oil prices as many economies remain under lockdown due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, curbing demand. Brent crude LCOc1 traded at around $30 on Tuesday, still less than half its close at the end of last year and below the $31.48 price before the output cut deal was reached. Aramco’s shares closed at $31.10 on Tuesday, below the $32 price of its IPO late last year that initially raised $25.6 billion and became the world’s largest. Saudi Arabia, which owns more than 98% of the oil giant, is likely to sell new international bonds soon, according to sources, as the output cut deal further squeezes revenues hit by the plunge in oil prices.

FILE PHOTO: French businessman and Lazard France CEO Matthieu Pigasse poses during an interview with Reuters in Paris, March 28, 2014.  REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File PhotoCenterview, which currently operates in Europe from its London outpost, has also poached former Lazard bankers Nicolas Constant and Pierre Pasqual. Pigasse, who left Lazard in October after 17 years at the firm, will head a 14-strong team of bankers focusing on merger and acquisition (M\u0026A) deals as well as corporate restructurings and financing needs for French and European clients.  The 51-year old media mogul, who helped rescue the Le Monde group, will also pioneer sovereign advisory on behalf of Centerview - a business that the U.S. boutique bank has not tackled before. Pigasse has built a reputation for himself after advising world governments including Iraq, Greece and Argentina in their debt restructuring efforts. A former advisor to the French Treasury, he boasts long-standing relationships in France’s tight-knit world of finance and has worked with companies including L’Oreal (OREP.PA) and Danone (DANO.PA). The Frenchman also secured a high-profile mandate to advise state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco on its initial public offering (IPO) last year and will continue looking for opportunities in the Gulf, where oil firms have been hit hard by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Centerview has been trying to lure Pigasse for the past nine months in a bid to advise France’s key companies and ramp up its continental European business in the wake of Britain’s departure from the EU. “Despite current challenges, we are confident that businesses in France and across Europe are resilient and will be essential contributors to the global economic recovery,” said Centerview’s co-founder Blair Effron. The boutique firm, which was launched by Effron and co-founder Robert Pruzan in 2006, has ambitious plans for its Paris office located on the upmarket Avenue Matignon. It wants to hire another five to ten junior bankers in Paris in the coming months to boost its ability to provide long-term support to crisis-hit clients on a broad range of topics. Constant, who quit Lazard just weeks before Pigasse, will serve as his right-hand man having been named partner of the firm alongside Pigasse, while Pierre Pasqual will serve as a managing director. But the newly-built team will only be able to interact using video-conferencing tools as Paris remains locked down and French authorities have banned outside exercise during the daytime. With the French economy officially entering a recession, Centerview’s Paris hub will gradually try to position itself to advise on deals in other battered economies including Italy and Spain. Pigasse said Centerview’s decision to press ahead with the office launch was “an act of confidence in the future” and praised its “entrepreneurial culture.” He pledged to support “French and European companies in dealing with the crisis and preparing for recovery in the best possible conditions.” The U.S. firm ranked poorly in first quarter global M\u0026A league tables, slipping to 21st place, according to Refinitiv data, while its fierce rival Evercore ranked fourth after Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan. Centerview has typically advised U.S. clients when working on European deals and recently represented jeweller Tiffany (TIF.N) in sales discussions with LVMH (LVMH.PA), and Synthorx when the U.S. biotech was sold to Sanofi (SASY.PA) last year.

    "Title": "Tiffany says Australian regulators seek more time to review LVMH deal",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A Tiffany \u0026 Co. logo is seen outside a store in Paris, France, November 22, 2019. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes(Reuters) - Tiffany \u0026 Co (TIF.N) said on Wednesday Australian regulators have sought more time to review LVMH’s (LVMH.PA) multi-billion dollar purchase of the U.S. jeweler due to the coronavirus outbreak, potentially delaying closure of the deal.   The France-based owner of luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton offered to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion last November, and the deal is expected to close mid-2020. Tiffany said it still aimed to close the deal by that time, subject to the review by the Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). The FIRB is experiencing delays in processing transactions and requested extending the statutory review deadline of April 8 to until Oct. 6, which LVMH has accepted, according to a regulatory filing www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/98246/000156459020015787/tif-8k_20200407.htm. The deal was cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on March 26, while a draft filing has been submitted in Europe and pre-filing discussions are going on with the European Commission, Tiffany said. Tiffany’s shareholders approved the deal in February.  Both LVMH and Tiffany have temporarily closed several outlets across the globe, including Tiffany’s iconic flagship Fifth Avenue store in New York, to curb the spread of the virus.

    "Title": "WeWork sues SoftBank for dropping $3 billion tender offer",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - A WeWork board committee that negotiated a $3 billion tender offer with SoftBank Group sued the Japanese conglomerate on Tuesday for abandoning the deal, accusing it of succumbing to “buyer’s remorse” amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. FILE PHOTO: A WeWork logo is seen at a WeWork office in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 30, 2019.  REUTERS/Kate MunschThe tender offer was part of a $9.6 billion rescue financing package that SoftBank agreed with WeWork in October that gave it control of the company. Since then, the office space-sharing start-up’s occupancy rates have plummeted, as customers in big cities stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus. SoftBank said last week it would not press ahead with the tender offer because several pre-conditions had not been met, frustrating WeWork’s minority shareholders, who were expecting a payout. They included co-founder and former Chief Executive Adam Neumann, venture capital firm Benchmark Capital and employees with equity in the company.   While SoftBank cited the business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as one of the reasons it would not complete the tender offer, it also pointed to U.S. criminal and civil investigations into WeWork and the failure to restructure a joint venture in China as grounds for abandoning it. An independent two-member special committee of WeWork filed the lawsuit, calling SoftBank’s decision to terminate the tender offer wrongful. The committee comprises Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital, and Lew Frankfort, who is the former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach. “SoftBank’s failure to consummate the tender offer is a clear breach of its contractual obligations ... as well as a breach of SoftBank’s fiduciary obligations to WeWork’s minority stockholders, including hundreds of current and former employees,” the special committee said. WeWork argued the investigations were not material to the company’s business, and that SoftBank had pursued an alternative deal for the China business with minority investor Trustbridge Partners, voiding its right to walk away from the deal. Trustbridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “Nothing in the special committee’s filing today credibly refutes SoftBank’s decision to terminate the tender offer. SoftBank will vigorously defend this suit. The special Committee will not prevail in this mistaken attempt to force SoftBank to purchase their shares when it is not legally obligated to do so,” SoftBank said in a statement.  WeWork is asking a Delaware judge for so-called “specific performance,” or performance of a contractual duty, so that SoftBank is forced to complete the tender offer, or for damages in an amount to be determined at trial. Gabriel Rauterberg, a University of Michigan law professor, said that courts in Delaware, where WeWork is suing SoftBank, are generally receptive to arguments about specific performance.  CASH CRUNCH Even without the tender offer, SoftBank and its $100 billion Vision Fund currently own 52.3% of WeWork. While most of the financing agreed in October has been provided to WeWork, some $1.1 billion of senior secured debt was contingent on the tender offer being completed. WeWork was facing a cash crunch before its deal with SoftBank in October, and was forced to scrap plans for an initial public offering, as investors soured on its loss-making rapid expansion. WeWork told bond investors last month that it had $4.4 billion in cash and cash commitments as of the end of December, and would be able to weather the economic downturn. SoftBank has installed Sandeep Mathrani, former chief executive of Brookfield Properties’ retail group, as WeWork’s new CEO. Neumann, who attracted criticism for his management of the company before being ousted in September, had negotiated the right to sell $970 million of his shares as part of the tender program. Some $450 million of the tender offer was allotted to current and former employees. SoftBank has so far invested more than $13.5 billion in WeWork. In two previous tender offers in 2017 and 2019, WeWork shareholders and employees had received a total of $2.3 billion from SoftBank.  But the conglomerate has been under growing financial strain, with souring tech bets bringing it under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management and pushing it into a radical pledge to raise $41 billion by selling down core assets to raise cash for share buybacks and to reduce debt.

    "Title": "Cineworld suspends dividend, defers pay to cushion virus hit; shares soar",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Cineworld’s (CINE.L) shares soared 36% on Tuesday after it suspended its dividend and said it was in talks with landlords, film studios and major suppliers to offset the impact of the closure of all its 787 cinemas due to the coronavirus pandemic. FILE PHOTO: A Cineworld cinema logo is pictured in Canary Wharf in London, Britain, March 11, 2020. REUTERS/Keith Weir/File PhotoThe world’s second-largest cinema operator said its executive directors agreed to defer their salaries and bonuses and reiterated it was in talks with lenders over its ongoing capital requirements. Shares in the company, which have plunged 78% this year, were up 36% at 53.9 pence by 1250 GMT, making it the biggest gainer on the midcap index .FTMC. Some analysts again said the company should abandon its $1.65 billion takeover of Canadian rival Cineplex (CGX.TO), a deal that had led Cineworld to take on additional financing of about $2.2 billion, triggering concerns about its debt pile.     But the company, which said it continued to monitor progress of the deal, told Reuters it had not changed its attitude since  last month when finance chief Nisan Cohen said they “love the deal”. Cineworld also said last month it could fail to meet its debt commitments in a worst-case coronavirus scenario where its cinemas were shut for up to three months. “Without Cineplex, and with aggressive action on the fixed cost base, we believe that this period could be materially extended,” Peel Hunt analysts said, referring to how long it could cope with its cinemas closed. Its debt stands at $3.5 billion, excluding leases and the additional financing of Cineplex. The company said its non-executive directors will also defer their fees and that it was also curtailing all unnecessary spending.  It has suspended dividend payment for the fourth-quarter and upcoming quarters in 2020. “Combined with the company’s heavy borrowings, built up to fund big acquisitions, this made the decision to defer the payout an inevitability...Coming out the other side will not be easy,” AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould said. Cineworld’s combined credit score, which measures how likely a company is to default in the next year on a scale of 100 (very unlikely) to 1 (highly likely), was “1”, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. The United States, where the company operates 500 cinemas and generates three quarters of its revenue, has by far seen the most confirmed virus cases at more than 355,000. “We welcome the emergency support programmes to protect jobs and business that have been announced in our markets and will access them as appropriate,” Cineworld said.

    "Title": "Hit by coronavirus, Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot seek to boost cash before merger",
    "Content": "LONDON/MILAN/PARIS (Reuters) - With their sales hammered by the coronavirus outbreak, car makers Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot’s owner PSA have postponed their shareholder meetings and are looking at ways to boost cash reserves ahead of their planned merger. FILE PHOTO: A Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) sign is at the U.S. headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan, U.S. May 25, 2018.  REUTERS/Rebecca CookThe two car makers have turned to their banks to secure much needed cash, and Fiat Chrysler (FCA) is looking at debt guarantees that the Italian government approved on Monday to support local companies, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. FCA, whose legal headquarters is in the Netherlands, runs several plants in Italy and may qualify for the government scheme which offers more than 400 billion euros worth of liquidity and bank loans to companies hit by the pandemic, the source said, cautioning no decision had been made. A spokesman for FCA declined to comment. The crisis triggered by the virus has virtually erased demand for new vehicles, pushing automakers to temporarily halt most production. In late March FCA secured a 3.5 billion euro credit line, with an initial 12-month term that can be extended six months. This added to existing credit facilities worth 7.7 billion euros. The Italo-American firm, chaired by John Elkann, scion of the Italian Agnelli family, would need to cut its ordinary dividend if it decides to pursue state aid from Italy. The emergency decree says companies looking to apply for Italy-backed loans must refrain from approving dividend payments for a year. FCA’s decision to postpone the shareholders’ meeting to late June has analysts speculating that its ordinary dividend worth 1.1 billion euros could be axed or postponed. “While the merger process is proceeding, the postponement of the AGM will raise markets’ concerns of a potential cancellation of the ordinary dividend,” said Intesa Sanpaolo analyst Monica Bosio. Equita analyst Martino De Ambroggi echoed that the most likely scenario was “the cancellation or at least the postponement of the ordinary dividend for both FCA and PSA.” PSA, which proposed a similar 1.1 billion euro dividend, also decided to postpone its annual shareholders’ meeting to June 25. But the company is not expected to tap state funding, another source close to the company said. The French firm, led by Carlos Tavares, said on Monday it had agreed new credit lines worth about 3 billion euros. It is sitting on undrawn credit facilities worth about 3 billion euros. SPECIAL DIVIDEND? FCA shares are down around 45% since late February when the virus started spreading in northern Italy. PSA’s stock is down 32%. In December, they clinched a binding agreement to create the world’s fourth-largest carmaker, with shareholders of each group holding 50 percent in the new entity. As part of the deal, FCA is set to pay a 5.5 billion euro special dividend to its investors. Bankers and analysts have questioned FCA’s ability to pay such a windfall. “It’s no longer wise to get rid of so much cash,” said the first source with knowledge of the matter. A second source close to the deal said that while both parties were still committed to tying the knot, they needed to see how the crisis evolved before deciding whether to renegotiate merger terms. Analysts at Jefferies have said the merger is key to the two firms’ long term competitiveness but some adjustments are “inevitable.” They pointed to the special dividend which is expected to be paid in early 2021, just before consummation. Global carmakers may end up selling between 19 and 24 million fewer cars this year, representing a 22% to 27% fall in global sales, according to a study by Alix Partners. This means global auto firms would be below break-even, losing more than 100 billion euros in cash flow globally, the study said, adding that for every month of idled production in Europe, car makers would lose 7 billion euros of cash flow.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A customer conducts a mobile money transfer, known as M-Pesa, at a Safaricom agent stall in Nairobi, Kenya October 16, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas MukoyaNAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s leading telecom firm Safaricom (SCOM.NR) and South Africa’s Vodacom (VODJ.J) said on Monday that they had completed the acquisition of popular mobile money platform M-Pesa from Britain’s Vodafone (VOD.L).      “The transaction... will accelerate M-Pesa’s growth in Africa by giving both Vodacom and Safaricom full control of the M-Pesa brand, product development and support services as well as the opportunity to expand M-Pesa into new African markets,” they said in a statement. The companies did not disclose the value of the transaction, which was first announced in 2019 and completed via a newly-created joint venture, but last year Safaricom’s then chief executive Bob Collymore said the deal could be worth about $13 million. M-Pesa, launched in Kenya more than a decade ago, has evolved from a basic mobile money transfer application into a fully-fledged financial service platform, offering loans and savings in partnership with local banks, plus merchant payment services.   It has grown to become the largest payments platform in Africa, with 40 million users and processes over a billion transactions every month, according to Safaricom and Vodacom’s joint statement.  It is now available for subscribers in Kenya, Tanzania, Lesotho, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Mozambique and Egypt. “This is a significant milestone for Vodacom as it will accelerate our financial services aspirations in Africa,” said Shameel Joosub, Vodacom Group CEO.  “Our joint venture will allow Vodacom and Safaricom to drive the next generation of the M-pesa platform – an intelligent, cloud-based platform for the smartphone age.” Reporting by Omar Mohammed, additional reporting by Emma Rumney in Johannesberg; editing by George ObulutsaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Exclusive: Neiman Marcus advances bankruptcy preparations - sources",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Neiman Marcus Group is stepping up preparations to seek bankruptcy protection, after the coronavirus pandemic forced the debt-laden U.S. luxury department store chain to close its stores, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. FILE PHOTO: Shoppers enter and exit the Neiman Marcus at the King of Prussia Mall, United States' largest retail shopping space, in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, U.S., December 8, 2018.  REUTERS/Mark MakelaNeiman began holding confidential discussions this week with bondholders about possible financing that would help the company continue operating while under bankruptcy protection, the sources said. The company has also started similar discussions in recent days with its lenders, one of the sources said.  Up until this week, Neiman had received inquiries from creditors about its next moves but had not commenced discussions about a possible bankruptcy, some of the sources said.  Even though these talks are advancing, the Dallas-based retailer is several weeks away from a potential bankruptcy, and it is still possible that it manages to escape it, the sources said.  Creditors could give Neiman additional time to make upcoming debt payments due this month while restructuring discussions continue, which could result in a transaction that reworks financial obligations outside of bankruptcy proceedings, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Neiman declined to comment. Last month, the company said it was “evaluating all courses of action to preserve our financial strength” because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Neiman reached a deal last year with creditors to rework debt and avoid a bankruptcy filing, gaining more financial breathing room. But the coronavirus outbreak forced the company to close all Neiman, Bergdorf Goodman and Last Call stores it operates through the end of April, and furlough most of its 14,000 employees. The closures have resulted in a cash crunch just before significant interest payments on portions of its more than $4 billion of debt are due starting April 15.   Portions of Neiman Marcus’s term loan were trading at roughly 40 cents on the dollar this week, well below face value, indicating significant investor concerns about repayment, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. The price for a set of Neiman bonds has also fallen.   Neiman has struggled following a $6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firm Ares Management Corp and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in 2013. Like many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers, it has faced relentless competition from e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc.. Ares had no immediate comment, while the CPPIB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Neiman was able to persuade creditors to restructure debt last year without resorting to bankruptcy proceedings, pushing out due dates on its financial obligations. But the deal added to the company’s interest expenses on debt, and did not address its struggling business, which has worsened. A Neiman bankruptcy filing would likely be contentious. A trustee for some of the company’s bondholders sued Neiman last year, claiming the company and its owners robbed investors of the value of luxury e-commerce site MyTheresa in the earlier debt restructuring. “If this storied brand files for bankruptcy ... MyTheresa will take center stage,” said Dan Kamensky, managing partner at Marble Ridge Capital LP, one of the bondholders. “The private equity owners stripped the … MyTheresa asset from the company without paying a dime and leaving a carcass of a company for its creditors.” Neiman has said the allegations are meritless and that its handling of MyTheresa was proper.

FILE PHOTO: The sign outside the Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond store is seen in Westminster, Colorado, June 22, 2016 REUTERS/Rick WilkingThe internet retailer of flowers and gift baskets agreed in February to buy the Pmall.com business from home furnishings retailer Bed Bath \u0026 Beyond, with a closing date of March 30. Bed Bath said in its complaint, filed in Delaware’s Court of Chancery, that 1-800-Flowers told it on March 24 the COVID-19 outbreak, the disease caused by the coronavirus, denied the company the resources to close the deal and integrate the business. 1-800-Flowers said it was delaying closing to April 30, according to the filing. “Even a calamitous event such as COVID-19 does not permit a party to avoid its obligations,” the lawsuit said.  1-800-Flowers said it still wanted to proceed with the deal, but the pandemic kept it from satisfying conditions of the deal, due to which it has requested a delay in the transaction’s closing. “While we still desire to proceed with the transaction, we maintain that the conditions to closing the transaction have not been satisfied in light of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the shut-down of the PersonalizationMall.com facilities until at least April 30, 2020”, the company said, adding it aims to defend itself against the lawsuit. Shares in Bed Bath were down about 6.8% in late trading at $3.53, while 1-800-Flowers stock was down about 3.5% at $12.20. Both trade on the Nasdaq, which was up about 0.6%. The sale agreement contains a “material adverse effect” clause, or MAE, that permits 1-800-Flowers to terminate if there is an event that has a disproportionate impact on Pmall.com, as opposed to a broad-based impact across the economy. Bed Bath’s court papers said 1-800-Flowers did not invoke the MAE. Wall Street’s dealmakers are closely watching the impact of the pandemic and unprecedented economic shutdown. Deal activity in the United States fell by half from a year ago in the first three months of 2020, to $252 billion. Many pending deals were negotiated months before the pandemic intensified, raising doubts if buyers will make good on their agreements. U.S. auto parts company BorgWarner Inc threatened to walk away from a $951 million deal to buy Delphi Technologies on Tuesday after the automotive equipment supplier drew down on a credit line without its acquirer’s approval. Despite the unprecedented impact of “stay home” orders that have shut businesses globally and contributed to a plunge in oil prices, corporate lawyers have questioned if buyers can get out of mergers. Delaware judges have a history of holding buyers to deals, although in 2018 Germany’s Fresenius SE was allowed to end its $4.75 billion takeover of Akorn Inc, after the generic drugmaker suffered a dramatic decline in business.

    "Title": "WeWork troubles deepen as SoftBank pulls $3 billion tender offer",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp said it has terminated a $3 billion tender offer for additional WeWork shares agreed last year with shareholders, drawing threats of legal action and plunging the floundering office space company further into crisis. The tech investment giant said in statement that given its duty to its shareholders it could no longer proceed with the deal, citing criminal and civil probes into the startup, WeWork’s failure to restructure a joint venture in China and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.        A special committee of WeWork’s board said it was disappointed and is considering “all of its legal options, including litigation.” SoftBank’s decision to rescind the offer means the Japanese firm is no longer obligated to proceed with a further $1.1 billion in debt financing for WeWork. It also underscores the depth of the disarray at WeWork, which is undergoing a drastic restructuring and whose earnings are at risk as many countries impose orders to stay at home due to the pandemic. “WeWork is in real trouble and SoftBank’s withdrawal from the share purchase worsens the situation materially,” Richard Windsor, an independent analyst, wrote in a note.  The startup, which lost $1.25 billion in the third quarter, told investors last week that it had $4.4 billion in cash and cash commitments and would be able to weather the economic downturn. The tender offer, which would have mostly benefited a select group of shareholders including ousted co-founder Adam Neumann, had been agreed in October as part of bailout plan by SoftBank after WeWork’s IPO plans flopped. Investors had been concerned about its losses and a business model that involves taking long-term leases and renting out spaces for a short term. In November, sources said the New York State Attorney General was investigating WeWork, examining whether Neumann, indulged in self-dealing to enrich himself. A spokeswoman for Neumann declined to comment at the time. SoftBank said in its statement that there were “multiple, new, and significant” pending criminal and civil investigations in which authorities have also requested information about WeWork’s financing activities and communications with investors. Slideshow (2 Images)Following the termination of the deal, SoftBank shares closed up 2.5%, outperforming a 1.4% decline for the broader Tokyo market.  SoftBank itself has been under growing financial strain, with souring tech bets bringing it under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management and pushing it into a radical pledge to raise $41 billion by selling down core assets to raise cash for share buybacks and to reduce debt. A merger of its U.S. wireless unit Sprint with T-Mobile US was completed on Wednesday, which will provide an undetermined gain to be booked in the quarter ending June and will reduce strains on its balance sheet.

    "Title": "T-Mobile completes merger with Sprint",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc said on Wednesday it officially completed the $23 billion merger with Sprint Corp, solidifying its position as the No.3 wireless providers in the United States. The deal comes after a long legal battle between multiple state attorneys general which argued that a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint would be anticompetitive.  The combined company will now operate under the T-Mobile name and will trade on the NASDAQ as “TMUS.” The deal also enables T-Mobile and Sprint to join their high-band and low-band spectrum that could allow a faster roll-out of national 5G. Sprint acknowledged risks in an SEC filing, saying that its internal controls over financial reporting could negatively impact the combined company.  A U.S. federal judge approved the deal, which was originally valued at $26 billion, in February, rejecting a claim by a group of states that the proposed transaction would violate antitrust laws and raise prices. The deal closed without a final decision from the California Public Utilities Commission. The CPUC issued a proposed decision in March to approve the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint with conditions and the final decision is slated to come on April 16. T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to abide by any provisions set forth by the California commission. Also, on Wednesday, a federal judge in Washington gave court approval to the Justice Department’s decision to approve the merger. The department had given its approval to the deal in July on condition the combined wireless company sell off assets to Dish Network, making the latter the fourth-largest provider in the U.S. wireless space. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai applauded the decision and said that it would boost the U.S. position in the race to 5G. FILE PHOTO: A sign for a T-Mobile store is seen in Manhattan, New York, U.S., April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon StapletonT-Mobile’s long-time Chief Executive John Legere is stepping down from his position effective immediately as part of the deal. Legere was originally set to leave at the end of April, with Mike Sievert, T-Mobile’s president, as his successor. Legere, who helped launched the company’s notable “Un-carrier” strategy, will serve on T-Mobile’s board of directors. T-Mobile shares rose 2.34% on the announcement.

    "Content": "BERLIN/MUNICH (Reuters) - The German government stands ready to take over Condor as a deal for the airline to be bought by Polish rival LOT is likely to collapse in the industry turmoil caused by the coronavirus crisis, several people familiar with the matter told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: A banner reding \"Condor we love flying\" is seen next to a check-in counter of airline Condor at the airport  in Frankfurt, Germany, September 24, 2019.  REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachLOT agreed in January to buy Condor for about 300 million euros ($328 million) to create a leading European aviation group with more than 20 million passengers a year. But with planes unable to fly because of travel restrictions, compounded by a plunge in demand over fears of contagion, airlines worldwide have grounded most of their fleets, and many have said they need government support to survive. Last week, airlines urged governments to speed up bailouts to rescue the air transport industry, as they doubled their estimate of 2020 revenue losses from the health crisis to more than $250 billion. LOT owner PGL has made completion of its takeover deal contingent on certain financial guarantees that the German government considers unacceptable, the sources said, adding no final decision on Condor’s immediate future had been taken. “LOT has some issues with the deal financing”, one of the people said, while another said a government decision could come as early as this week. Condor said it was in talks with all parties involved and no decision had been made yet, declining to comment further. PGL and the German economy ministry declined to comment. Nationalising Condor would only be for a limited time as Germany aims to restart a sales process as soon as the stranglehold on the travel industry from the coronavirus pandemic has eased, the sources said. Condor is a former unit of Thomas Cook, the holiday company that collapsed in September. A 380 million euro ($415 million) state bridging loan allowed the carrier to be rescued.  Last week, Condor applied for an additional 200 million euros in state aid in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, according to people familiar with the matter.

    "Content": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - KKR \u0026 Co (KKR.N) has shelved a plan to sell Singapore-based Goodpack, which provides shipping containers and logistics services, after the coronavirus outbreak hit valuations, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: Trading information for KKR \u0026 Co is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., August 23, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe private equity group had received bids from a few consortiums after tapping more than a dozen potential buyers late last year, the sources said, adding that a deal could have valued Goodpack at about $2 billion.     “Till about six weeks ago, bidders were interested and a deal looked likely but there’s a lot of uncertainty in the current environment,” said one of the sources. The sources declined to be identified as the shelving of the deal has not been made public. KKR declined to comment. A successful deal would have ranked as one of the largest private-equity backed sales in Asia excluding Japan and Australia for the past few years, according to data from Refinitiv.     KKR acquired Goodpack for about S$1.4 billion ($985 million)in 2014 and delisted it from Singapore Exchange. Goodpack then changed senior management, expanded into new markets such as food and chemicals and set up offices in Europe and the United States. Goodpack’s network is embedded in the supply chain of many multinational companies and its business is expected to weather any short-term downturn, the source said. It also caters to global customers in the rubber and automotive sectors with operations across 80 countries and about 5,000 delivery and collection points.  The coronavirus pandemic has prompted governments around the world to impose social distancing and other containment measures that have brought many businesses to a near standstill.  The value of deals in Asia-Pacific fell 20% in the first three months of 2020 versus a year earlier, data from Refinitiv shows.

    "Title": "Xerox abandons $35 billion hostile bid for HP",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - U.S. printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp walked away from its $35 billion hostile cash-and-stock bid for HP Inc on Tuesday, after the coronavirus outbreak weighed on its campaign to take over the PC and printing equipment manufacturer. FILE PHOTO: The company logo for Xerox is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 11, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid - RC15DA6446E0/File PhotoXerox’s decision came after it said earlier this month it would postpone meetings with HP shareholders to focus on coping with the coronavirus pandemic.  It represents a victory for HP CEO Enrique Lores, who faced a takeover battle as soon as he took over the reins of the Palo Alto, California-based company in November, and a defeat for Xerox CEO John Visentin, a former Hewlett-Packard and IBM Corp executive with ties to the private equity industry who took over as Xerox CEO in 2018. It is also a blow for billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who owns big stakes in both companies and had pushed for their merger.  Xerox was set to challenge HP’s board at the latter’s annual meeting of shareholders in May, but will now abandon this effort as well as its tender offer for HP’s shares, the company said in a statement. “While it is disappointing to take this step, we are prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and other stakeholders, and our broader response to the pandemic, over and above all other considerations,” Xerox said. Xerox added that there were compelling long-term financial and strategic benefits in a potential combination with HP. While it is possible that the companies will choose to engage once the coronavirus crisis subsides, Xerox’s decision means that it will not get another chance to put such pressure on HP until its next annual shareholder meeting in spring 2021.   The banks financing Xerox’s takeover bid “never wavered in their commitments” despite the market turmoil fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said. “HP would like to thank our shareholders, partners, customers and employees for their input and continued support through this process,” HP said in a statement.  The market rout triggered by the global coronavirus outbreak has led many companies to hit the pause button on mergers and acquisitions, sabotaging the hopes of corporate advisers who expected a dealmaking bonanza this year. Both Xerox and HP have seen their business suffer in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, though HP’s stock has proved more resilient, as employees working for home to protect themselves from the virus boosted revenue for its PCs and other office equipment. Xerox shares have lost more than half their value in the last five weeks, while HP shares are down about a quarter.  PRINTING IN DECLINE The printing industry is in decline as companies and consumers turn to digital documents to save money and help the environment. This has put pressure on companies in the sector to consolidate and reverse their revenue decline through acquisitions that can boost their market share. HP, which separated from servers and networking equipment provider Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Inc in 2015, has participated in this consolidation, acquiring Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s printer business for $1.05 billion in 2017. Nevertheless, HP had been reluctant to engage in deal discussions with Xerox since November, when the latter launched its takeover campaign after reaching a settlement with Fujifilm Holdings Corp  that resolved a legal dispute over their 57-year-old joint venture and a previous attempt to merge, yielding a $2.3 billion after-tax payoff for Xerox. FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the logo for HP Inc. at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., November 18, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoHP said that Xerox’s offer undervalued it and disputed the $2 billion value of potential cost synergies that Xerox put forward in a possible combination. It argued that its sale to Xerox would saddle the combined company with too much debt, and also raised questions on the impact on Xerox’s supply chain of losing Fujifilm as a partner. HP engaged in deal talks with Xerox last year at the invitation of Icahn, a top Xerox shareholder who has since also acquired a stake in HP. These talks stalled after the companies failed to agree on the amount of confidential information they shared with each other. HP relies on its desktop and notebook PCs business for the majority of its net revenue but gets the bulk of its earnings from its printing hardware and supplies division.

    "Title": "Global M\u0026A dwindles as coronavirus batters world’s economies",
    "Content": "LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisitions activity plunged 28% in the first quarter to its lowest level since 2016 as the devastating economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March, compounding a slow start to the year for dealmakers. FILE PHOTO: Test tube with fake blood labelled with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is placed on dollar banknotes in this illustration taken March 27, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Deal activity in the United States dropped by half to $252 billion in the first three months from a year ago, driving global volumes down to $698 billion from $964 billion in the first quarter of 2019, according to Refinitiv data. Asia volumes dropped 17% year-on-year to $142.9 billion. Europe saw its deal volume more than double to $232 billion thanks to a handful of mega-deals clinched just weeks before the virus started battering the continent’s economies. With large swathes of the globe shut down, the M\u0026A pipeline remains patchy and likely to be dominated by rescue deals, restructurings and nationalizations as governments and central banks try to shore the economy up. “This crisis is unique. It is something that our generation has never witnessed before,” said Luigi de Vecchi, chairman of EMEA banking capital markets advisory at Citigroup. “When stock markets tumble 30% you need to hope to renegotiate a deal if you have the contractual ability to do so. However, if you haven’t reached an agreement you are likely to delay the signing until you have better visibility,” he said. Russia used its National Wealth Fund (NWF) to finance this quarter’s biggest deal - the $39 billion purchase of the country’s largest lender Sberbank. Other big deals included insurance broker Aon’s $30 billion all-stock takeover of rival Willis Towers Watson and the $18 billion private equity-led buyout of Thyssenkrupp’s elevators business. “We have seen the number of deals announced globally drop 43% year-over-year in the last two weeks,” said Bank of America’s global M\u0026A head Patrick Ramsey, adding the downward trend was expected to continue into the second quarter. “Once we get to the back-end of this, we will see a meaningful snap-back in activity. The degree of that snap-back will depend on the economic outlook and equity market recovery,” Ramsey said. STATE INTERVENTION The U.S. Federal Reserve and its global counterparts moved aggressively this month to introduce emergency rate cuts aimed at restoring investor confidence. “If market turmoil and volatility persist, we will see a polarization between companies in more resilient sectors which can better withstand this crisis, and distressed players in the worst-affected sectors which will be starving for cash,” said Paulo Pereira, a founding partner at Perella Weinberg Partners. Pereira added that a rebound in M\u0026A activity will hinge on whether distressed companies will have a “material destabilizing impact” on other sectors, including financial services.  “Inevitably there will be some impact because economic activity is interlinked,” Pereira said. “But the financial system is now better capitalized than in 2008 and the actions of governments and central banks will be key in determining the ability of the economy to rebound,” he said. Dealmakers expect more political intervention to save companies of strategic national interest. “There will be rescue deals and there will be many of them,” de Vecchi said. “You will see a return of state intervention, triggered not only by protectionist moves to deter unwanted takeovers but by the sheer necessity to rescue entire industries, revive strategic assets and, where possible, create domestic champions through consolidation,” he said. The bleak outlook has proved a boon for investment banks to whom clients have turned for advice on how to weather the storm. “Periods of turmoil underscore the value of a trusted adviser and a global platform that spans not only M\u0026A but also restructuring and sovereign advisory,” said Peter Orszag, Lazard CEO of financial advisory. “We remain active advising clients as they navigate the drivers of how long the crisis will last, how they should adjust their balance sheets, and what else they should be doing to respond,” Orszag said. Investment banks face tough decisions on whether to approve potentially risky loans in order to stay close to their clients, hoping to win mandates when dealmaking picks up again. “This is the moment when your clients are coming to you to ask for financing and not just for advice. Supporting your clients in these difficult times is a test of loyalty that can prove vital for a long-term relationship,” de Vecchi said.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A woman walks pass by a sign of Vivendi at the main entrance of the entertainment-to-telecoms conglomerate headquarters in Paris, France, November 21, 2019. REUTERS/Gonzalo FuentesPARIS (Reuters) - Vivendi (VIV.PA) closed on Tuesday the sale of a 10% stake in Universal Music Group (UMG) - home to Taylor Swift and The Beatles - to a Tencent-led consortium, in a deal giving UMG an enterprise value of 30 billion euros ($33 billion). The French conglomerate, in which billionaire Vincent Bollore’s holding company has the biggest stake, said it would now examine the possible sale of other minority interests in UMG, with an initial public offering of those assets planned for early 2023. The previously announced deal allows both companies to expand in a recovering global music market. It gives Tencent more access to U.S. artists, while UMG can tap into the Asian market, including big-selling “K-Pop” Korean pop stars. Although Tencent Music’s user base is nearly three times that of Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N), it has fewer paying users.  Earlier this month, Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME.N) warned it would likely see “much softer” first-quarter revenue growth due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The Tencent consortium also has the option to buy an additional up to 10% of UMG’s share capital on the same valuation basis until January 15 next year.  Tencent Music Entertainment can also buy a minority share of UMG’s subsidiary housing its Greater China operations.  Vivendi said it plans to use the proceeds from the transactions for substantial share buyback operations and acquisitions.

U.S. drugmaker Pfizer announced the deal in July as part of a strategy allowing it to focus on its more profitable newer medicines.  The European Commission set an April 22 deadline for its decision after Mylan put in its offer on March 27. In line with its policy, the EU competition watchdog did not provide details of the concessions. It will now seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the offer, demand more or open a full-scale investigation.

    "Title": "ProSieben shares rally after CEO Conze's departure",
    "Content": "MUNICH/BERLIN (Reuters) - Shares in ProSiebenSat.1 Media (PSMGn.DE) rallied by 9% on Friday after the abrupt departure of Chief Executive Officer Max Conze ended a drama-filled tenure that unraveled after his deputy denounced a “soap opera” at the German broadcaster. FILE PHOTO: German media company ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE Chief Executive Max Conze speaks to reporters during a briefing in Berlin, Germany, October 25, 2019. REUTERS/Annegret Hilse/File PhotoProSieben announced in a late-night statement that Conze, 50, was leaving with immediate effect and Chief Financial Officer Rainer Beaujean - who joined last July from a packaging company - would also assume his responsibilities. In a statement issued after a supervisory board meeting on Thursday evening, Beaujean said ProSieben “will now return to focusing more strongly on our core segment of entertainment and on sustainably profitable business”. Conze had sought to accelerate a pivot to digital commerce and advertising to offset a relentless decline in ProSieben’s core commercial TV franchise, but while this preserved top-line growth it squeezed profitability and pushed up debt. The recent announcement of the $500 million takeover of New York dating app developer Meet Inc (MEET.O) incurred the disapproval of Italian broadcaster Mediaset (MS.MI), which took advantage of a precipitous decline in ProSieben’s share price to up its stake to 20%. Sources familiar with the matter say that Mediaset, controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, wanted ProSieben to change course and concentrate on its core media business. The Italian company has exerted steady pressure on ProSieben, resisted by Conze, to join a European media holding it is setting up to fight back against U.S. streaming giants led by Netflix (NFLX.O). Mediaset declined comment on Friday. TAKEOVER PLAY? Analysts at Citi said it was possible that Mediaset could partner with Czech investor Daniel Kretinsky, who owns a 10% stake in ProSieben, to make a takeover bid. Conze’s grip on the business had visibly loosened of late, with hand-picked allies he brought in from Dyson, the UK vacuum cleaner maker he headed before joining ProSieben in mid-2018, exiting the business. Deputy CEO Conrad Albert dealt a decisive blow to Conze’s prospects by criticizing ProSieben’s “boardroom soap opera” in a newspaper interview. The company took no action for days before saying Albert would leave by mutual consent. On a personal level, Conze is nursing losses after backing his own turnaround plan by investing 2 million euros ($2.20 million) of his own money in ProSieben stock.  ProSieben’s e-commerce bets bundled into its NuCom division - which include dating, sex toys and price comparison sites - will be sold off in due course, the company said.  Investor General Atlantic is a minority partner in NuCom.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has approved United Technologies Corporation’s planned merger with Raytheon Co, subject to conditions, the agency said on Thursday. UTC agreed in June to combine its aerospace business with U.S. contractor Raytheon and create a new company worth about $121 billion, in what would be the sector’s biggest ever merger. It won EU antitrust approval earlier in March. To win U.S. approval, the companies agreed to divest Raytheon’s military airborne radios business, including facilities in Indiana and Florida, and UTC’s military global positioning systems, including a facility in Connecticut.  The businesses are to be sold to BAE Systems Inc or another buyer approved by the Justice Department. The companies are the only Defense Department suppliers for military airborne radios and military GPS systems for air and sea, the Justice Department said. The Justice Department said that the two companies were among the few companies that made components for certain military satellites, including those that warn of missile launches. Because of this, the department also required the companies to sell UTC’s big space-based optical systems businesses.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A logo is seen during the inauguration of Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi's joint innovation lab in Tel Aviv, Israel June 10, 2019. REUTERS/Amir CohenPARIS (Reuters) - Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) could potentially invest in Renault (RENA.PA) as part of scenarios being discussed to reinforce an alliance between the French carmaker, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors, two sources familiar with the matter said.  French newspaper Les Echos reported earlier on Thursday, citing an unnamed executive familiar with the discussions and other unnamed sources, that Mitsubishi Corp, a conglomerate with a 20% holding in Mitsubishi Motors (7211.T), could take a 10% stake in Renault.  It said this was one scenario of many under discussion, which could also include restructuring plans and fresh cost savings schemes.  Nothing was yet settled and any decision might not be taken until May, when the alliance is due to present fresh measures to reboot joint operations and deliver on cost cuts, one of the sources said. Renault declined to comment.  Mitsubishi Motors counts Japan’s Nissan as its biggest shareholder, though ties run deeper between the other two members of the alliance. Nissan owns 15% of Renault, while the French carmaker in turn has 43% of Nissan.  Relations between Renault and Nissan took a turn for the worse following the arrest in Japan of former alliance supremo Carlos Ghosn in late 2018. He has since fled to Lebanon, from where he has stepped up his defense against accusations of financial misconduct. He denies any wrongdoing.  Renault and Nissan have since cleared the decks of many managers linked to the Ghosn era, but momentum for joint projects ground to a halt.  They have both vowed to try and re-energize the alliance, as carmakers face tumbling demand in emerging markets and costly programs to build new models, including in less polluting cars.  The coronavirus crisis has compounded problems for the sector as production grinds to a halt.

    "Title": "EU leaders to shield strategic firms from hostile interest amid crisis",
    "Content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will on Thursday back plans to defend healthcare, infrastructure and other firms seen as having strategic role from hostile foreign takeovers, draft EU summit conclusions show. FILE PHOTO: A general view of the Canary Wharf financial district in London, Britain October 24, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin CoombsListed companies worldwide have become easier targets as share prices have crashed during the coronavirus crisis, with vaccine makers and other firms that have emerged as crucial players in the fight against the virus attracting attention. Leaders of the 27 EU states in a videoconference starting from 4 p.m. (1500 GMT) will agree to take “all necessary measures to protect strategic assets and technology from foreign investments that could threaten legitimate public policy objectives,” according to draft conclusions of the call. The European Commission, the EU executive arm, issued guidelines on Wednesday to boost national defenses against takeovers. “As in any crisis, when our industrial and corporate assets can be under stress, we need to protect our security and economic sovereignty,” Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said. Among the firms that should enjoy special safeguards are those active in health, biotechnology, medical research and “infrastructures that are essential for our security and public order,” the commission said. Brussels promised 80 million euros ($88 million) last week to Germany-based CureVac, a biotech firm which the EU executive said had developed new technology that could slash costs for vaccines and provide a rapid response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The move followed reports that the U.S. administration was looking into how it could gain access to the potential vaccine being developed by CureVac. LASTING CHANGES? Under EU rules, states can already block takeovers in strategic sectors or impose supply commitments to meet national and EU vital needs. The guidelines are meant to make sure all available protective tools are used. EU leaders will support Brussels’ guidance, which chimes with a push last year from France and Germany to relax EU competition rules and facilitate mergers of EU companies in a bid to boost their size and defenses against foreign raiders. “This will contribute to the EU’s strategic autonomy, during the crisis and afterwards,” leaders will say, according to the draft text, in a new sign the virus emergency may have lasting effects on how the bloc functions and its global relations. Countries are already raising their defenses. Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said on Tuesday a national shield could cover industries deemed of strategic interest in the case of epidemic, seismic, information technology or geopolitical risks. France has openly called for repatriating production lines that rely on global supply chains disrupted during the epidemic, which erupted in China, the world’s largest manufacturer. In a bid to reduce disruptions to supplies, EU leaders will pledge to do their utmost to strengthen the sustainability of global value chains and “to adapt them as necessary.” Reporting by Francesco Guarascio; Editing by Edmund BlairOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have opened a full investigation into Johnson \u0026 Johnson’s acquisition of Takeda Pharmaceutical’s surgical patch product TachoSil, concerned that the deal could lead to reduced choice and higher prices for customers. Takeda, (4502.T) Japan’s biggest drugmaker, announced the sale of TachoSil, a surgical patch for bleeding control, to U.S. giant Johnson \u0026 Johnson’s (JNJ.N) subsidiary Ethicon for $400 million last May. The European Commission said a preliminary investigation found cause for concern because TachoSil is the market leader in Europe. Johnson \u0026 Johnson is also a major maker of surgical patches globally although it does not sell such dual patches in Europe. The EU competition enforcer said high development costs meant rivals would find it difficult to enter the market. “In this concentrated space, we need to carefully assess whether the proposed merger would lead to reduced choice for surgeons and patients, to higher prices for our health services, or to slower development of alternative solutions to manage problematic bleeding,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.

    "Title": "Boeing CFO says aerospace industry needs credit urgently, markets closed to new debt",
    "Content": "SEATTLE/WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing Co’s (BA.N) chief financial officer said on Tuesday the U.S. aerospace industry urgently needs credit to cope with the coronavirus pandemic but “markets essentially are closed” to new debt. FILE PHOTO: The Boeing logo is displayed on a screen, at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., August 7, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoGreg Smith also stressed the strategic value of a $4.2 billion deal to acquire the commercial planemaking arm of Embraer (EMBR3.SA), driving up shares in the Brazilian group. The comments on credit in an interview with Reuters appeared to underscore the U.S. planemaker’s opposition to granting equity as part of an industry-wide government bailout deal.  U.S. lawmakers have said they could demand stock or equity-based instruments like warrants or options as a condition of government loans.  “Having access to the credit markets is really important for us right now,” Boeing CFO Greg Smith said when asked whether Boeing could issue such instruments in return for support.  Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told Fox Business earlier on Tuesday that Boeing could “take a different course” if lawmakers “attach too many things” to a stimulus package. Boeing has sought $60 billion in U.S. government loans or loan guarantees for itself and the aerospace industry.  Congress was expected reach agreement on a stimulus and rescue package worth up to $2 trillion to respond to economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic as soon as Tuesday. Smith said Boeing, which drew down a $13.8 credit line it took in February but has a further $9.6 billion in reserve, was not in discussions to add new commercial debt facilities. “Not right now. The markets essentially are closed,” Smith said. “I mean, there’s really not much opportunity to raise any additional debt. That’s one of the challenges.” Rating agency Fitch Ratings meanwhile downgraded Boeing to ‘BBB’ from ‘A-‘, citing the rapid escalation of the pandemic and its effect on Boeing’s aviation markets and operations.  Despite such immediate pressures, Smith said Boeing was beginning to see signs of a recovery in China, echoing comments by Airbus (AIR.PA) Chief Executive Guillaume Faury on Monday.   Smith also said a tie-up with Brazil planemaker Embraer (EMBR3.SA) remained strategically important to the company. “As you know it’s in the middle of regulatory approval and so we are continuing to monitor that and working closely with the Embraer team,” Smith said. “Strategically, it’s still a great partnership and we have to get through the regulatory hurdles and we’ll see how long that takes. But it still remains a priority for us.” Shares in Embraer soared as much as 37% on his comments. In later trading they were up 24%. Smith’s comments were the first by a senior Boeing executive since market turmoil raised uncertainty over the deal last week, because of an apparent mismatch between Embraer’s market value and the price that Boeing is due to pay for control of its commercial aircraft unit. The tie-up has also been held up by delays in winning European Union approval.    Reporting by Eric M.

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri(Reuters) - The special committee of WeWork’s board is preparing for a fight against Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) saying that SoftBank should complete its tender offer promised to the office sharing company’s employees and shareholders. “Not only is SoftBank obligated to consummate the tender offer as detailed by the Master Transaction Agreement, but its excuses for not trying to close are inappropriate and dishonest”, the committee said in a statement on Sunday. In response, SoftBank said it maintains the ability to walk away from the tender offer if there is any material liability to WeWork, adding the offer has no impact on SoftBank’s commitment to WeWork or on the financial strength of the business. “SoftBank has informed stockholders that all of the agreed upon closing conditions must be satisfied before the tender offer can be completed,” a SoftBank spokeswoman said.   “As of now, they are not.” Reuters reported on Tuesday that SoftBank was considering pulling out of the $3 billion bid to buy additional shares in WeWork, because it feels the office-space sharing firm has not met the conditions for the deal.

    "Title": "Germany will block foreign takeovers to avoid economy sell-out",
    "Content": "BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany will protect domestic firms from foreign takeovers, two leading politicians said on Friday, after company valuations in Europe’s largest economy have been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic. FILE PHOTO: The financial district is photographed on early evening in Frankfurt, Germany, January 29, 2019.  REUTERS/Kai PfaffenbachMinisters have already promised liquidity support to businesses and introduced measures making it easier to reduce working hours rather than lay off workers. The cabinet is due to decide on further support measures on Monday, when a government source said it would back a supplementary budget worth around 150 billion euros ($161.18 billion). Germany's blue-chip DAX index .GDAXI, which comprises the country's 30 largest listed corporations, has plunged more than a third over the past month as the coronavirus outbreak has brought several economies to a near standstill. This has increased the risk of foreign companies snapping up rivals at a discount. “We will avoid a sell-out of German economic and industrial concerns. There cannot be any taboos. Temporary and limited state support as well as participations and takeovers need to be possible,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said. Automotive companies have been among the worst hit, with Daimler (DAIGn.DE), Continental (CONG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) shares down 44-48% over the past four weeks. Markus Soeder, state premier of Bavaria, where heavyweights such as Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and BMW (BMWG.DE) are based, said all legal options should be explored to block potential bids for German companies. “If most of Bavaria’s and Germany’s economy ends up in foreign hands once this crisis is over ... then it’s not only a health crisis but a profound alteration of the global economic order,” he said. “We need to brace ourselves for that.” EMERGENCY FUND German magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday that Berlin was considering a half-trillion-euro fund to support companies thrown into payments difficulties by the coronavirus crisis, which would be able to guarantee liabilities or even inject capital when needed. The plan is one of several being considered by officials as the government puts together a rescue package intended to keep the short-term havoc wrought by shutting down the economy from becoming a rout, an official told Reuters. One option is a 40-50 billion-euro ($43-$54 billion) “solidarity” fund for the self-employed and businesses with fewer than 10 employees, which could help them buy materials, pay rents and meet leasing payments. The details for this program are due to be thrashed out over the weekend. The roughly 500 billion-euro fund first reported by Der Spiegel is modeled on the 480 billion-euro Special Fund for Market Stabilisation that the government set up to support banks at the time of the financial crisis. The government is prepared to revive that fund if banks get into difficulties, Der Spiegel said. The finance ministry is currently considering direct support programs to a value of around 180 billion euros, the magazine said, adding that sum might be increased to 700 billion euros. Airline Lufthansa (LHAG.DE), which has been particularly badly hit, said on Thursday it would seek state help if the crisis persisted, adding this was not yet the case. German investor Heinz Hermann Thiele has increased his stake in Lufthansa to 10%, a regulatory filing showed on Friday.

Global stock markets have slumped since the coronavirus outbreak has halted most business activities, led to the fallout of many industries and spooked investors about a possible recession. According to the Bloomberg report, LVMH has discussed the plan with Tiffany’s board, which could give the potential transaction a green signal after reporting quarterly results. Tiffany is due to report its results on Friday.  LVMH is yet to make a decision on the transaction and is discussing potential legal hurdles to the idea, the report said.  Last month, LVMH was set to raise 9.3 billion euros from bond markets to help to finance the deal, which is expected to be completed in the middle of 2020. The latest move affirms the French company’s interest in Tiffany. Both LVMH and Tiffany were not immediately available for comment.

    "Title": "Factbox: The policies fueling liberal Senator Warren's presidential campaign",
    "Content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren found herself the favored target of her White House rivals during Tuesday’s presidential debate, with moderate Democrats repeatedly arguing she is too liberal to beat Republican President Donald Trump in next year’s election. FILE PHOTO: Democratic presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren speaks during the fourth U.S. Democratic presidential candidates 2020 election debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio U.S., October 15, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File PhotoWarren’s recent ascent in opinion polls has put her at the top of the 19-candidate field along with Joe Biden, the former vice president, in the race for the party’s 2020 nomination. Biden, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, led the charge against Warren on the debate stage in Ohio. They criticized her for being evasive on how to pay for Medicare for All and her other “pipe-dream” proposals. Afterward, Warren spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said the Massachusetts lawmaker “took heat” as the result of her momentum but stayed focused on her plans. “That’s how Elizabeth will win the nomination, beat Donald Trump and make big, structural change,” Orthman said. Here are some of the policies on healthcare, wealth and other topics that are among the bevy of proposals Warren has released since beginning her presidential campaign: MEDICARE FOR ALL Warren has praised former Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, for extending health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, but says that “it’s time for the next step.” Warren supports a Medicare for All bill in the U.S. Senate written by progressive ally and fellow presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. But while Sanders conceded in Tuesday’s debate that it was “appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up” in order to extend the government health insurance program that now covers individuals 65 and older, Warren repeatedly answered questions about taxes by saying that such a plan would result in lower overall costs for American families. Warren, who is known for her detailed policy plans, has not specifically laid out how she would finance a Medicare for All program. Her demurrals about taxes have prompted questions about whether she is still weighing options to pay for such a healthcare system and have provided openings for her moderate rivals to attack her ideas as unrealistic. WEALTH TAX Most of the Democrats vying for the party’s White House nomination have a plan to ensure wealthy Americans pay higher tax rates. Warren has proposed an “ultra-millionaire tax” on the top 0.1% of wealthiest households that would act as the funding mechanism for many of her policies, including universal childcare, universal pre-kindergarten and free public college tuition. Warren’s tax on wealth, not just income, would apply to households with a net worth of $50 million or more. Those households would pay a 2% tax on every dollar of net worth beyond $50 million and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth beyond $1 billion. The tax would affect just 75,000 U.S. households but generate $2.75 trillion over a decade, according to independent estimates.  Entrepreneur Andrew Yang said at Tuesday’s debate that implementing such a tax would be impractical. Klobuchar suggested Warren needed a “reality check.” Former U.S. Representative Beto O’Rourke suggested it was “punitive.” “I’m really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I’m punitive,” said Warren. ANTI-CORRUPTION Warren, who says many Americans have lost faith in government and calls Trump’s administration the most corrupt in U.S. history, has offered a host of proposals to eliminate the influence of big money in Washington. She has suggested creating conflict-of-interest laws that would require the president and vice president to put their businesses in a blind trust to be sold, require the disclosure of their tax returns, and ban all government officials - including those at the White House - from trading individual stocks while in office. In an effort to close the “revolving door” between lobbyists and government, Warren also would restrict lobbyists from taking government jobs and institute a lifetime ban on former presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, federal judges and Cabinet heads from becoming lobbyists. Warren has sworn off hosting big-ticket fundraisers for her presidential campaign and does not accept support from a type of well-funded political action committee known as a Super PAC. She rejects large contributions from executives in the fossil-fuel industry, big pharmaceutical companies, large tech companies, big banks, private equity firms and hedge funds. Warren has said if elected, she would make it illegal for corporate PACs to contribute to federal candidates, ban lobbyists from donating to or fundraising for candidates and strengthen limits on contributions that can be given to a single candidate. ANTI-TRUST Warren wants to break up big tech companies like Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc’s Google and Amazon.com Inc, which she says hold outsized influence and stifle competition.    Her proposal involves reversing anti-competitive mergers and restricting platforms from owning a marketplace while also participating in that marketplace. Warren, who previously put a billboard up in Silicon Valley calling for the breakup of big tech, has most recently gone toe to toe with Facebook over its policy of exempting politicians’ ads from fact-checking, which she said was helping Trump “mislead the American people.”    This month, leaked audio of an internal Q\u0026A meeting in July revealed Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg telling staff that Facebook would fight back if Warren, as president, tried to disband the company - and would win. He said the situation would “suck,” prompting Warren to fire off a retort on social media. “What would really ‘suck’ is if we don’t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,” she tweeted. IMMIGRATION Warren, like most of her White House rivals, has sought to distance her immigration policy from that of Trump, whom she frequently criticizes on matters such as border security.  Warren has said she would decriminalize migration by immediately issuing guidance to federal prosecutors that they not pursue cases related to administrative immigration violations. She would also separate immigration and law enforcement agencies into separate entities, and reshape the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement “from top to bottom.”  She would eliminate privately owned immigration detention facilities and only detain those who are a flight risk. Warren would create an immigration court system independent from the U.S. Department of Justice and raise the number of refugees allowed into the country. She has said she would work with Congress to pass comprehensive immigration legislation that would create a path to citizenship. CRIMINAL JUSTICE  Warren believes the criminal justice system is too punitive, locks up too many people and is stacked against the poor and disadvantaged, as well as minorities.  She has called for social services that help young people stay out of prison, including decriminalizing truancy and relying on counselors and teachers rather than police officers in schools.  Warren vows to repeal the 1994 crime bill, saying the United States has criminalized too many behaviors. She thinks judges should be given more discretion in sentencing and that mandatory minimum sentences should be eliminated for both major and minor crimes. Warren would legalize marijuana at the federal level and erase past related convictions. Like several other Democrats, she would eliminate the differences in sentencing for powder versus crack cocaine, as crack cocaine offenses have traditionally garnered longer sentences and been more likely to affect poor and minority defendants.  She would eliminate the cash bail system, under which defendants who can afford bail do not have to remain in jail pending their trials. CLIMATE Warren has outlined $3 trillion in federal investments for combating climate change that built on a plan offered by Jay Inslee, the Washington state governor who anchored his campaign on climate but dropped out of the White House race in August.  Warren also has woven climate into other plans, blending it with industrial policy, investing in green research, exports and manufacturing, and creating a federal procurement program for American-made renewable or emission-free energy for federal and state use and export.  Some of Warren’s climate-related proposals would be funded by reversing 2017 Republican tax cuts that largely benefit businesses and the wealthy. Warren’s plan seeks 100% zero emissions for most new vehicles by 2030 and 100% zero emissions in electricity generation by 2035.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: Signage is seen outside the entrance of the London Stock Exchange in London, Britain. Aug 23, 2018. REUTERS/Peter NichollsLONDON (Reuters) - European Union regulators have asked companies seeking to complete their desired mergers to delay submitting antitrust filings due to the coronavirus outbreak. That could affect the timelines of agreed deals. Among the biggest is the London Stock Exchange’s (LSE.L) proposed acquisition of Refinitiv. LSE agreed last year to buy the data and analytics firm in a $27 billion deal aimed at offering trading across regions and currencies. European competition authorities were expected to rule on the deal “around the summer,” an LSE board member said in January.  But on Monday a spokesperson for the European Commission said companies had been encouraged to delay merger notifications until further notice, pointing to “the complexities and disruptions caused by the coronavirus.” The spokesperson declined to comment on specific deals. The Commission had adopted “measures to respect the experts’ advice on social distancing,” he said. “This will affect to some extent our current working habits, but the Directorate-General for Competition is prioritizing actions to fulfil its mission and meet legal deadlines.” LSE said it remained committed to closing the transaction during the second half of 2020, adding that it continued to “engage constructively with the European Commission and other relevant regulators and stakeholders.”  LSE announced the purchase of Refinitiv last August, just 10 months after a consortium led by U.S. asset manager Blackstone (BX.N) completed a leveraged buyout of Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO). Obtaining regulatory approval was expected to be a lengthy process, possibly requiring the sale of some assets.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: The company logo for Xerox is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 11, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid - RC15DA6446E0/File Photo(Reuters) - Xerox Holdings Corp, which is in a proxy fight for control of HP Inc, said on Friday it would postpone meetings with shareholders of the personal computer maker amid the coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. printer maker added that it does not consider the decline in HP shares since the date of its offer as a broader sell-off could affect its bid. The pandemic has killed more than 4,900 people and at least 134,000 cases have been reported across the globe. The economic damage has also amplified, with stock markets continuing to be volatile. “We believe it is prudent to postpone releases of additional presentations, interviews with media and meetings with HP shareholders so we can focus our time and resources on protecting Xerox’s various stakeholders from the pandemic,” Xerox’s Chief Executive Officer John Visentin said in a statement on Friday. HP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier this month, HP rejected Xerox’s raised takeover bid of about $35 billion, saying it undervalued the personal computer maker. HP also requested its shareholders to reject the tender offer, saying it would disproportionately benefit Xerox shareholders relative to HP shareholders.  After Xerox raised its offer, HP said it would implement a poison pill plan to stop investors from amassing more than 20% stake in the company.

    "Title": "No more nut rage: activist fund takes on family-controlled Korean Air",
    "Content": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Days after photographs of broken windows and smashed china hit the newsstands revealing a Christmas Day family squabble in the home of Korean Air’s late patriarch, an activist fund received an unsolicited offer to help unseat the current chairman.  FILE PHOTO: People take part in a protest against the abuse of power by Korean Air Lines' chairman relatives, in central Seoul, South Korea, May 4, 2018.   REUTERS/Kim Hong-JiHeather Cho, eldest daughter of the founding family’s late patriarch, made the proposal to Korea Corporate Governance Improvement (KCGI), the biggest shareholder of Korean Air’s (003490.KS) parent Hanjin Kal (180640.KS), to oust her younger brother, Walter.  “I didn’t meet her initially because I didn’t take it seriously when she said she was ready to give up everything,” Kang Sung-boo, who runs the $380-million fund that is pushing for board and management overhaul at the airline, told Reuters. “I didn’t trust her until she agreed to take her hands off management.”  Heather Cho’s legal counsel did not comment on Kang’s recount of their discussions. Walter Cho was not available for comment. Hanjin said Cho, in light of “his clear vision, managing capability and global network,” was better suited for longer-term investment than professional managers.  Heather Cho is known for the ‘nut rage’ incident in 2014, after she forced a Korean Air plane to return to the gate because she did not like the way she was served nuts. A win by the 47-year-old activist investor will be a watershed moment in South Korea’s 67-year post-war corporate history which has been led by family-owned chaebol and spawned global industrial powerhouses such as Samsung and Hyundai. It will make Korean Air the first top chaebol group to shake off the grip of its founding family, as many conglomerates transition to the third generation of their founding fathers. Kang’s fund, KCGI, and his backers, including Heather, have mustered roughly 37% of the voting rights of Hanjin and seek to replace Walter Cho with mobile industry veteran Kim Shin-bae as a new board member to press restructuring of Korean Air.  Walter Cho, seen backed by other family members and Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), commands about 40% of the voting rights.     The proxy fight would also be a major distraction for the loss-making airline which warned this month that the virus outbreak could threaten its survival, after it scrapped more than 80% of its capacity and ordered cabin crew on leave.  TURNING POINT With limited success in South Korea for activist shareholder campaigns by the likes of Elliott, Kang did not initially think of replacing Walter Cho, whose family, including Heather, controls about 33% of Hanjin.  “We were simply hoping to prod Korean Air to cut debt and stop investing in unprofitable businesses,” he said, adding that his proposed restructuring offers the carrier huge upside potential, given its solid core earnings power.  The homegrown activist fund took a stake of just 9% in Hanjin in 2018, enough to ruffle its feathers.  “They refused twice to meet us, effectively saying we were just one of ten thousand shareholders with whom they can’t meet individually. That really disappointed me.” Hanjin said many activist funds seemingly advocating shareholder rights ended up taking profit, and private funds’ threats to management do not help long-term development.  Events, however, took a dramatic turn after the family patriarch died last April, sparking a feud among the siblings over how best to manage the group that escalated into a proxy battle.  “My campaign will be a catalyst for a more transparent and fair governance system. This is a good signal for foreign investors,” he said, adding poor corporate governance has kept Korean stocks trading at a sharp discount.  Investor scrutiny of Korea’s family groups has grown since a 2017 corruption scandal involving South Korea’s ex-president and Samsung chief and as succession looms for the third generation of founding families.  “The third generation is taking over, but their abilities aren’t proven, so the process of finding the most suitable CEO has become more transparent,” said Lee Chang-min, a Hanyang University management professor, calling the proxy fight “a turning point.”  Kang said Walter, Hanjin CEO since 2014 and Korean Air CEO since 2016, should take responsibility for the airline’s debt-to-equity ratio of more than 800% - one of the highest among airlines - which he blamed on decisions such as a takeover of doomed Hanjin Shipping in 2014 and aggressive fleet expansion.  “Both the brother and sister are not good managers,” he said. Heather was briefly jailed in 2015 over the nut rage incident.  South Korean proxy adviser Korea Corporate Governance Service (KCGS) recommended shareholders vote for Walter Cho to keep his board seat and approve other Hanjin Kal board nominees in a Friday report, citing Hanjin’s efforts to improve governance and sell assets since KCGI became a shareholder, while the intentions of other shareholders in KCGI’s alliance remain opaque, including those of Heather Cho.  FIRST SUCCESS CASE? Family-controlled conglomerates often lack checks by outside board directors, who “may just say yes to the family,” said Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association.  “This is why we’re interested in the work being done by KCGI, because it’s been pushing for board improvements.”  But the fate of Kang’s bid remains uncertain, as both sides compete to build up stakes and doubts persist over the viability of the overhaul.  One of Korean Air’s employee unions said professional managers proposed by KCGI were no more than “ceremonial figures”, and criticised Heather for joining hands with a speculative fund. “It is like sleeping with the enemy. They have formed an alliance against a common foe,” said Park Sang-in, a professor and chaebol reformist. “(Heather) Cho is very unpopular, and she is a stumbling block to winning votes.” FILE PHOTO: The logo of Korean Airlines is seen on a B787-9 plane at its aviation shed in Incheon, South Korea, February 27, 2017.  REUTERS/Kim Hong-JiKang, who earned a business degree from the prestigious Seoul National University and wrote books on corporate governance, started KCGI in 2017 with some investors who had been rewarded by his successful exit from mid-sized builder Yonjin Construction \u0026 Engineering.  Kang said KCGI wants to boost long-term corporate value and reiterated there would be no workforce restructuring if he won the battle, which he acknowledged would be uphill.  “It is a miracle that we have come this far, given the situation in the Republic of Korea.” Editing by Miyoung Kim and Jacqueline WongOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Content": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carrier Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) has been forced by the coronavirus epidemic to halt the sale of the international operations of its airline caterer LSG, the company said on Thursday, confirming an earlier Reuters report. Airplanes of German carrier Lufthansa stand at the air terminal of Frankfurt Airport, Germany, March 12, 2020.   REUTERS/Ralph OrlowskiAirlines around the globe are feeling the pain as travel demand withers because of the spread of the virus. Several have grounded many flights and ditched their financial outlooks. European airline stocks plunged as much as 20% on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would restrict travel from Europe to the United States for 30 days to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The German government will meet representatives of airlines and labor unions on Monday to discuss the impact of the outbreak and possible liquidity aid. Even before the epidemic began Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said the airline’s catering business faced challenges because of the large number of locations it serves, high staff costs and exposure to currency exchange rates. However, Lufthansa managed to negotiate a deal to sell the European operations of LSG to Switzerland-based Gategroup, in December.  That deal is going ahead as planned, Lufthansa said. The auction for the international business launched only weeks ago with information packages being sent out to prospective bidders, who were asked to sign confidentiality agreements, people close to the matter have said. Lufthansa has been hoping to reap a valuation of roughly 1 billion euros ($1.11 billion) from a sale of the international catering operations to a peer such as Gategroup, Dnata, SATS or private equity firms, people close to the matter have said. “Lufthansa has to wait until it can fly normally again and define the virus impact on the catering unit before continuing with the auction”, one of the people said. A Lufthansa spokesman said the sale of the international LSG operations had been halted.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Sinclair Oil weighs offers for company sale: sources",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sinclair Oil Corp, which operates two Wyoming refineries and has licensed more than 1,000 branded gasoline stations, is reviewing offers to buy the company, according to three people familiar with the matter.     FILE PHOTO: Sinclair Oil CEO Ross Matthews walks with Sinclair Oil's Dino balloon during the 90th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 24, 2016.  REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File PhotoA Sinclair sale could fetch between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity as the talks are private.  However, many U.S. refineries are already on the block and have struggled to find buyers. The sharp drop in equity and energy prices also makes striking mergers and acquisitions deals in the current climate very difficult.  The company, headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, will review initial incoming offers and will determine whether serious talks are merited, two of the sources said. A determination on the viability of the offers is expected within the month. It has retained boutique firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt \u0026 Co as an advisor; neither it or Sinclair would comment for this story. Sinclair operates an 85,000 barrel-per-day refinery in Sinclair, Wyoming and a 25,000 bpd refinery in Casper, Wyoming. The two refineries process crude from the Rocky Mountain region, while the Sinclair operation also runs Canadian crude. The company has 1,500 branded gasoline stations across 29 states, according to its website. It is best known for its trademark green dinosaur mascot, Dino, seen on gas station signs and depicted in a balloon that has flown in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York several times. The company also has a network of crude oil and finished-product pipelines and terminals in the Rocky Mountain and midcontinent regions. Refiners operating in the Rocky Mountain region, such as  Par Pacific (PARR.N), CVR Energy Inc (CVI.N), Delek Energy (DK.N) and HollyFrontier Corp (HFC.N), would be among the most logical buyers for Sinclair. None of those refiners immediately responded to requests for comment. The company was founded in 1916 by Harry Sinclair.  Former Chief Executive Earl Holding consolidated the refineries and gasoline stations. Holding’s son-in-law Ross Matthews now serves as CEO, and the family still controls the company.  In addition to an outright sale, Sinclair would consider strategic options like a reverse Morris Trust, which would take the company public but allow the family to maintain a stake, according to one source. Some assets, including the company’s hotels and ranches, would not be included in a transaction, one of the people said. In 2012, Sinclair began licensing gas stations throughout the United States, allowing them to use Sinclair branding in markets not supplied by Sinclair fuel.

    "Title": "Cineworld could breach debt terms in worst-case virus scenario",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Cineworld (CINE.L) could fail to meet its debt commitments in a worst-case coronavirus scenario, it warned on Thursday, though it plans to press ahead with its $1.65 billion takeover of Canadian rival Cineplex (CGX.TO). FILE PHOTO: Workers repair a sign at a Cineworld cinema in Bradford northern England, March 24, 2016. REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo The London-listed company operates about 9,500 screens globally, with more than 7,000 in the United States, where it generates three quarters of its revenue. The Cineplex deal announced three months ago will make Cineworld the biggest cinema operator in North America. But Cineworld, the biggest shareholder of which sold part of its stake on Monday to refinance debt, is also grappling with worries over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and investor short-selling on concerns over the company’s debt position. Shares in the company plunged nearly 49% on Thursday to their lowest in more than 10 years at 45.59 pence.  Cineworld said that in a worst-case scenario it might have to close all cinemas for up to three months.  Though it said this would be unlikely, it added that the potential indicates “the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt about the group’s ability to continue as a going concern”. Jefferies analysts previously estimated that the company was burning about $115 million a month, had $470 million in readily available cash and could deal with four months of all cinemas being closed. Cineworld’s debt stands at $3.5 billion, excluding leases, with additional financing of about $2.2 billion for Cineplex as it begins to pay for the deal announced only a couple of years after its $3.6 billion acquisition of Regal Cinemas.  “We have a legal contract with Cineplex; we are committed to the deal,” Cineworld finance chief Nisan Cohen told Reuters. “It’s a very attractive deal, very strong synergies and there is no changing the plan”.  If Cineworld were to abandon the deal, it could face a fee of up to 28.3 million pounds ($36.1 million). The company expects the deal to be completed in the first half of 2020, but JP Morgan analysts expect it to be delayed.      Cineworld reiterated that the coronavirus outbreak has so far had no material impact on its theatre admissions, but that could change with the delayed release of films such as the new James Bond movie. Cohen emphasised that delayed releases would merely push back attendance by movie-goers until later in the year, with the company saying it is excited about forthcoming films such as “Black Widow”, “Wonder Woman 1984” and “Top Gun Maverick”.

Separately on Wednesday, an administrative judge with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a decision approving the proposed merger on condition the companies meet milestones: for example, giving nearly all of California 5G networks by the end of 2026, with download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second. The CPUC is scheduled to make a final decision on April 16. California, Washington, D.C., and other states that fought the deal will be reimbursed for up to $15 million in litigation costs and receive enforceable commitments on pricing and job protections, Becerra’s office said. The companies agreed to offer all the plans that T-Mobile had in place in February 2019, or better, to residents of the plaintiff states for five years, according to a copy of the signing document seen by Reuters. New T-Mobile has committed to offering residents of the plaintiff states two low-cost plans for at least five years, including one for $25 per month with 5 gigabytes of high-speed data. The merged company agreed to offer all of T-Mobile and Sprint’s retail employees in good standing in the plaintiff states substantially similar employment. The plaintiff states involved in the settlement are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin. “While I would have preferred this megamerger not to move forward, I am pleased to have secured significant concessions for Connecticut consumers to lock in rates and protect Connecticut jobs,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. New York had previously said it would not appeal and was not part of the settlement. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission signed off on the merger last year after the companies agreed to divest Sprint’s prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television company Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), and give it access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations.

    "Title": "PepsiCo aims for energy boost with $3.85 billion Rockstar deal",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) on Wednesday made its biggest bet in the energy drinks market with a $3.85 billion deal to buy Rockstar Energy Beverages, opening a new front in its long-running battle with Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). The deal is also the latest move by PepsiCo’s new chief executive officer, Ramon Laguarta, to reduce the company’s dependence on its core sugary drinks and salty snacks, which have been increasingly shunned by health-conscious consumers. Pepsi last July announced the acquisition of South African maker of cereal and fruit juice Pioneer Food Group, a few months after closing its $3.2 billion buyout of carbonated drink-machine maker SodaStream. The Rockstar deal comes about two months after Coca-Cola, which owns a stake in Monster Beverage Co (MNST.O), rolled out Coke-branded energy drinks in the United States, after launching in European markets last year. PepsiCo, which already distributes Rockstar products in some markets, has a smaller presence in the energy space with its Mountain Dew Kickstart and Mountain Dew Game Fuel brands. “With Rockstar underneath their wings, they’ll have a family of energy drinks... they can coordinate the activity of an entire family of brands to meet a variety of needs of people,” Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. Laguarta has previously said the company was looking to expand its presence in the caffeinated beverages market, as longer working hours in the United States was helping increase demand for a quick energy fix. Spending by consumers globally on energy drinks rose 9.9% to $12.72 billion for the year ended February 2020, compared with a 2.6% increase in sales of soft drinks to $26.96 billion, according to market research firm Nielsen.   Credit Suisse analyst Kaumil Gajrawala said PepsiCo’s previous distribution deal with Rockstar limited its ability to participate more meaningfully in the energy drink category. Founded in 2001, Las Vegas-based Rockstar initially aimed straight for major player Red Bull, by having a wider variety of flavors and selling cans twice as big for the same price. However, the brand, whose bright yellow logo can be seen on extreme sports teams and at music festivals, still remains far behind the Austrian giant, as well as Monster.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File PhotoMonster and Red Bull, together accounted for over a third of the global energy drink market in 2019, according to data from Euromonitor International.  Pepsi said the deal is not expected to impact its revenue or earnings per share in 2020. The company’s shares fell 2.9% in early trading in a weak New York market.

    "Title": "Telefonica, TIM plan joint bid for Oi's mobile business in Brazil",
    "Content": "BRASILIA (Reuters) - Shares in Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT4.SA) and TIM Participações SA (TIMP3.SA) rose in the morning trading as both companies said they are planning a joint offer to buy the mobile unit of bankrupt Brazilian carrier Oi SA (OIBR3.SA). FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Telefonica headquarters in Madrid, Spain, June 12, 2018. REUTERS/Juan Medina/File Photo  The move comes months after the struggling carrier, which filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2016, told market participants early in December it had hired financial advisors to put a value on its mobile unit.  Preferred shares in Oi rose as much as 18% on Wednesday morning, while TIM stocks surged up to 8.3% and Telefonica Brasil climbed 4.4% before trimming earlier gains. TIM and Telefonica Brasil informed Oi’s advisor Bank of America of their interest in kicking off talks for a potential acquisition of all or part of Oi’s mobile division. If their bid is successful, the two companies would divide up that business, securities filings showed, without disclosing how the division would be. Telefonica, the Brazilian subsidiary of Spain’s Telefonica SA (TEF.MC), operates Brazil’s largest wireless carrier under the brand Vivo. TIM, which is controlled by Telecom Italia SpA (TLIT.MI), said it had informed its board of directors of their approach. It is not the first time that TIM and Telefonica join forces to broaden their operations amid an increasingly competitive market. In December, both signed network-sharing agreements involving 2G, 3G and 4G networks. In a separate filing, Oi said the joint bid attempt, which it described as “sounding out the market,” showed that there was interest in its mobile operation.   “So far, however, there is no commitment from Oi or any other third parties to materialize such disposal nor has any biding instrument been signed,” Oi added. In September, Reuters reported that Oi was in talks with the two firms to sell assets and avoid insolvency. Executives from all three major carriers in Brazil - Telefonica Brasil, TIM and America Movil SAB de CV’s (AMXL.MX) Claro - said at the time they could consider a deal with Oi. Analysts at BTG Pactual see TIM and Telefonica Brasil’s joint offer for Oi’s mobile unit as positive for all players involved.  “As they will not compete with each other for the asset, preventing the entry of a new competitor and capturing great synergies with the deal,” they wrote. Oi, in turn, will have the opportunity to raise cash to partially pay its debt and accelerate investments in fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), BTG analysts added.

    "Title": "College textbook merger raises 'serious concern' among U.S. lawmakers",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, speaks during a House Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., U.S. December 12, 2019. Alex Edelman/Pool via REUTERS/File PhotoWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. lawmakers expressed serious concern on Tuesday about the effect of a planned merger of college textbook publishers Cengage Learning Holdings II and McGraw-Hill Education Inc, saying the deal would create a new industry leader with nearly half the market. Representatives David Cicilline, chair of the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel, and Jan Schakowsky, chair of an Energy and Commerce consumer protection panel, urged the Justice Department to scrutinize the merger to ensure it is legal under antitrust law. In the letter, Cicilline and Schakowsky noted how few college textbook makers were left in the market and that prices had risen 184% since 1998. “It has also been reported that the merging companies are working to convert the market to all-digital course materials through an ‘inclusive access’ model, in which students are automatically billed for subscription access to textbooks,” the lawmakers wrote. They said an all-digital model would prevent students from shopping around to get cheaper prices, and “destroy” the used book market. A spokeswoman for Cengage said: “We continue to have a constructive dialogue ongoing with Department of Justice and other regulators outside the U.S.” In their letter, the lawmakers estimated that Cengage has 24% of the market while McGraw-Hill has 21%. This means the deal, which was announced in May 2019, would create a giant with about 45% of the market.  The current market leader, Pearson, has about 40 percent of the market, while Wiley has about 7 percent.

    "Title": "Financial firms around the world ramp up contingency plans as coronavirus hits",
    "Content": "FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks and other large financial companies in major cities across the world ramped up their emergency measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus on Tuesday, with Barclays Plc (BARC.L)  and BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) confirming one case in their New York offices.     FILE PHOTO: A man walks past a Deutsche Bank office in London, Britain July 8, 2019. REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File PhotoThe steps including telling staff who had been exposed to someone with the virus to self-quarantine for 14 days, splitting operations so that some staff work from home or back-up locations and deep cleaning offices.  Barclays told staff on Tuesday that a trading floor employee in its Midtown Manhattan office tested positive for the virus and told employees who worked near or met with the individual to self-quarantine, according to a memo seen by Reuters. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) also confirmed that an employee at its Purchase, New York, campus, roughly 45-minutes north of Manhattan, tested positive for the virus.  A BlackRock employee in its 40 East 52nd Street office in New York informed the company on Monday evening that they had been diagnosed with COVID-19, according to a spokesman. The employee had no symptoms, but the company did a deep clean and close colleagues were told to work from home for 14 days, the spokesman said. The asset manager said business continuity plans were working, including provisions for teams to alternate working from the office and from home to limit exposure. Starting Wednesday, Citigroup Inc (C.N) will divide its entire North America workforce into two groups that will alternate working from the office and other places in one-week shifts, according to a source familiar with the plans.  Trading staff will largely report to back-up sites and other teams like communications will work from home during off-weeks, the sources said.  Similar arrangements could pose risks for markets continuing to function smoothly, analysts said. “With several large dealers having announced split staffs and widespread work from home arrangements, we believe markets are about to experience arguably the most significant large-scale operation risk event since 2001,” JPMorgan fixed-income market strategists wrote in a note on Tuesday. EUROPEAN CASES In Europe, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and BBVA (BBVA.MC) reorganized operations after employees were infected. Deutsche Bank has split some of its trading operations across sites in Frankfurt, while Spain’s BBVA has shut one building at its headquarters in Madrid. The spread of the coronavirus is increasingly disrupting financial companies’ operations and adds to the impact of a weaker economy on their businesses. “Banks will see a weakening of their loan book quality as the effects of the virus will reduce global travel and factory output, and dampen domestic demand in Europe,” Moody’s analyst Bernhard Held said. Private equity firm KKR \u0026 Co Inc (KKR.N) said late on Monday that an employee at its London office had tested positive, causing it to temporarily close both its sites in the city. Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA.L) said on Tuesday it was planning to split its British and U.S. investment teams into groups and have them work separately as part of contingency planning. Slideshow (3 Images)Traders at the world’s biggest banks began last week swapping their plush city center offices to work from suburban outposts in New York and London, facing lengthy commutes as their employers attempt to reduce the disruption caused by coronavirus. The measures by Deutsche on Tuesday are expected to affect dozens of people and last until at least March 27. The bank also split some operations in London on Monday, following similar moves in places including Italy and China. “We expect no impact on our ability to operate our full range of services for our clients and recognize that this setup will require extra effort and discipline from all,” Deutsche said in a memo to staff.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr said on Tuesday the bank is “very open” to acquisitions, especially those that would speed the growth of its existing  businesses.  “”We’re ... very open to the proposition of acquisitions that fill gaps or accelerate elements of our growth plan,” Scherr said at a conference convened via conference call and  webcast, rather than in-person, due to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. There has been wide investor speculation about Goldman’s appetite and ability to do mergers or acquisitions since rival Wall Street bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N) announced plans last month to buy discount broker E*Trade (ETFC.O). Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon has set ambitious targets for the bank to grow its fledgling online consumer bank, Marcus, its credit card business and cash management platform. But industry insiders are skeptical that it can grow quickly without doing a deal. Scherr said the bank is not currently looking to do “larger material transactions ... in the near term.” “I think you’ll find us to be much more acquisitive in the context of accelerating and facilitating the growth of business initiatives that are there, none of which would necessarily present themselves as... material to the firm overall,” he added. Scherr also touched on the coronavirus and its impact on the bank’s day-to-day operations and markets.  He said the bank currently has no known cases of coronavirus among its staff, but that it continues to roll out precautionary measures, including splitting teams up to work at separate locations and having some staff work from home on a rotating basis.  Scherr said the bank is monitoring risk across all market sectors and has seen a “reduction broadly in liquidity” and some challenges in the “cost of funding.” But he said there are no major signs that corporate clients are under stress.

    "Title": "Intel says flawed EU antitrust decision underpins $1.2 billion fine",
    "Content": "LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Intel on Tuesday said EU antitrust regulators got it wrong when they fined the chipmaker 1.06 billion euros ($1.2 billion) more than a decade ago for thwarting a British rival in a case that could affect Google and Qualcomm. FILE PHOTO: U.S. chipmaker Intel Corp's logo is seen on their \"smart building\" in Petah Tikva, near Tel Aviv, Israel December 15, 2019. Picture taken December 15, 2019. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File PhotoThe U.S. company set out its arguments at the General Court in a re-hearing of a case seen as testing the European Commission’s power to go after U.S. tech giants which offer incentives such as rebates to lure customers from competitors. EU antitrust enforcers in 2009 said Intel tried to block Advanced Micro Devices by giving rebates to computer makers Dell [DI.UL], Hewlett-Packard Co, NEC and Lenovo for buying most of their chips from Intel. The General Court is hearing the case for the second time after the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), Europe’s highest, in 2017 disagreed with its 2014 ruling backing the Commission’s decision, in a major setback to the EU competition watchdog. It told the lower tribunal to re-examine the case and whether exclusivity rebates actually harmed competition. The Commission’s decision was fundamentally flawed, Intel’s lawyer Daniel Beard told the panel of five judges. “The Commission either took a wrong approach in its decision or it carried out an as efficient competitor (AEC) test and it got it wrong,” he said. An AEC test is an economic analysis that determines if a dominant company knocks out competitors that are as efficient or more efficient through anti-competitive practices while pushing out a less efficient rival may not be problematic for regulators. Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan criticised Intel for seeking to re-open the entire case. “That was assessed very exhaustively in 2014. Intel’s request is a second bite at the cherry,” he told judges. The Association for Competitive Technology is supporting Intel while French consumer body UFC is backing the Commission. A judgment is likely to come next year while the losing party can appeal to the CJEU. Qualcomm has challenged a 997-million-euro EU fine for paying iPhone maker Apple to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel.  Alphabet unit Google has also challenged a record 4.34-billion euro EU antitrust fine levied for using its Android mobile operating system to squeeze out rivals.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Aon alleges fraud in arbitration over $300 million Brazilian deal: documents",
    "Content": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - British insurance broker Aon Plc (AON.N) has accused the founder of Brazilian health and benefits insurance broker Admix of defrauding it when it acquired the company four years ago in a 1.35 billion reais ($300 million) deal, according to arbitration and court documents reviewed by Reuters. The sale contract with Admix founder Cesar Antunes da Silva included a clause calling for Aon to pay him up to 150 million reais two years after the deal closure if certain revenue targets were met. Another 80 million reais were placed in an escrow account as guarantee for any problem in the deal, a common practice in M\u0026A transactions.  Citing what it called “fraud and omissions” by da Silva in the sale process, Aon in 2018 did not pay the earn-out clauses or release the amount in the escrow account, according to the documents. Aon is seeking at least 200 million reais in damages via arbitration. Lawyers for da Silva said Aon was trying to use the arbitration to compensate for losses stemming from its own “mismanagement” of Admix after the acquisition, according to the documents. They said the insurer took two years to complain of omissions and are demanding that Aon pay the remaining value in the escrow account and the earn-out payments. Aon and da Silva’s lawyers declined to comment for this story, saying the arbitration was confidential. The arbitration, which began in December 2018 in Sao Paulo, is registered by the International Chamber of Commerce under the number 24146/GSS and details of its contents have not been previously reported.  The dispute underlines how disappointing the deal has proven for Aon, which is aiming to become the world’s largest insurance broker. When it was announced, the then head of Aon’s health and benefits division, John Zern, said the acquisition doubled the brokerage giant’s presence in Brazil, while its head for Risk Solutions in Latin America, Fernando Pereira, said the deal would enhance Aon’s activities in Latin America. Both have left the company since the deal. At the time, Admix had 1.4 million beneficiaries across 6,700 companies of all industries and sizes and placed 2 billion reais in health and benefits premiums a year.  Aon has also asked the arbitration judges to revalue Admix, alleging irregular underwriting policies, and to reimburse the price difference. The alleged underwriting irregularities happened only after the company was sold, da Silva’s lawyers say, according to the documents. Aon also alleges Admix failed to inform it about contract cancellations, including the cancellation of a high number of contracts before the deal closed by health care operator Unimed. Da Silva argued in his response in the arbitration that most of those were transferred to other insurance brokers within the same group. Aon also accused the Admix founder of failing to disclose significant labor lawsuits filed by its own employees.  Aon’s arbitration lawyers also accused a former Admix insurance broker of intimidating witnesses because he sued certain of the British insurer’s employees who had made depositions within the arbitration proceedings and accused him of fraud. The broker, Nadjair Diniz Barbosa, and his lawyer declined to comment. Aon did not disclose the arbitration in its 2019 financial statements as it has done with other arbitration proceedings in New Zealand and the United States, and antitrust investigations in Europe. Aon declined to comment on why the arbitration was not disclosed in the financial statements. Aon announced on Monday a $30 billion deal to acquire rival Willis Towers Watson (WLTW.O) and become the world’s largest insurance broker.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: Reinhard Ploss, CEO of German semiconductor manufacturer Infineon and CFO Sven Schneider, pose before the company's annual shareholder meeting in Munich, Germany, February 20, 2020   REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File PhotoBERLIN (Reuters) - Shares in Infineon Technologies (IFXGn.DE) rallied in early trading on Tuesday after a U.S. national security review raised no concerns over its proposed $10 billion takeover of Cypress Semiconductor Corp (CY.O).  Infineon shares opened up 6.1%, regaining some ground lost on a report last week that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had advised President Donald Trump to block the deal on national security grounds. CFIUS, a body led by the U.S. Treasury, informed Cypress that it had determined “there are no unresolved national security concerns” with the merger, the San Jose, California-based company said in a statement. Cypress shares surged 45% to $22.20 in after-hours U.S. trading on Monday. Infineon said that, while the CFIUS review was now complete, the transaction remains subject to approval from China’s State Administration for Market Regulation and other customary closing conditions under the merger agreement. Munich-based Infineon, announcing the deal last June, said it would create an automotive leader with a 13% market share by combining its prowess in managing electric drivetrains with Cypress’s edge in in-car entertainment. Infineon, a constituent of Germany’s DAX blue-chip index, had hoped for a lift into the world’s top-10 semiconductor makers through the deal.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Blackstone in talks to take developer SOHO China private in $4 billion deal - sources",
    "Content": "HONG KONG (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc is in exclusive talks to take SOHO China Ltd private in a $4 billion deal, said two sources, in one of its biggest bets yet on the Chinese market and which sent the target’s shares to a 21-month high. FILE PHOTO: The ticker and trading information for Blackstone Group is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) April 4, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoThe U.S. private equity firm entered exclusive discussions in early February with Hong Kong-listed SOHO China, a major prime office developer in China. The U.S. firm offered HK$6 ($0.77) per share to take the company private, said the people with direct knowledge of the matter. The price represents an almost 100% premium to the HK$3.03 average price of SOHO China’s shares in January.  SOHO China’s shares jumped as much as 39.9% to HK$4.17 following the Reuters report - their highest since June 2018 - before trading in them was halted at 11:12 local time on Tuesday. The details of privatising SOHO China, founded in 1995 by Chairman Pan Shiyi and Chief Executive Zhang Xin, are expected to be finalised in the coming weeks, said the people, declining to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to media.  Blackstone would also take over the debt of SOHO China, said one of the people, which stood at 32.68 billion yuan ($4.70 billion) as of the end of June 2019, according to its interim report. The move demonstrates Blackstone’s confidence in the world’s second-largest economy in the face of a softening property market and economic slowdown. The New York-based alternative asset management giant is a long-time property specialist. In September, it raised $20.5 billion in the world’s largest-ever real estate fund. In 2018, it raised $7.1 billion for its biggest-ever property fund in Asia. China’s office rental sector is expected to come under strain from the economic impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak, although surveys have shown most investors so far expect the sector to bounce back rapidly. SOHO China’s investment properties were valued at $8.78 billion as of the end of June last year, showed its 2019 interim report. The developer started to sell prime commercial property assets last year as its founders looked to shift their focus to overseas markets. Among the sales were eight office projects in Beijing and Shanghai. Blackstone was one of the buyers, said the second source.  Buying the company is simpler than acquiring its properties individually and would provide Blackstone with more certainty in completing a transaction, said both people. Husband and wife Pan and Zhang own 63.93% of SOHO China and plan to retain a small stake after any deal with Blackstone, said the second source. Blackstone declined to comment. SOHO China did not respond to requests for comment.  SOHO China, known for its distinctive, modern developments and celebrity management team, went public in Hong Kong in 2007, as Chinese property firms tapped markets to fund expansion in what was then a booming sector. The IPO priced at HK$8.3 per share, but the stock plunged to a low of HK$1.006 during the global financial crisis in the following year. Pan, known for his outspokenness about the real estate market, has often appeared in fashion magazines and other media alongside Zhang, who worked at Goldman Sachs in the early 1990s. SOHO China changed its business model in 2012 to build-and-hold from build-and-sell to maintain a more stable income stream from rents rather than property sales, but that has led to a slide in underlying profit.  SOHO China posted a net profit of 565 million yuan in the first six months of 2019, down 48% from the same period a year earlier.  Blackstone’s China real estate investments include $1.25 billion paid for Mapletree Business City Shanghai and VivoCity Shanghai.

    "Title": "Aon buys Willis for $30 billion in world's largest insurance deal",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Aon Plc (AON.N) said on Monday it would buy Willis Towers Watson Plc (WLTW.O) for nearly $30 billion, in an all-stock deal which will make it the world’s biggest insurance broker and give it more pricing power, but also attract regulatory scrutiny. FILE PHOTO: A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo.   REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File PhotoThe acquisition, the insurance sector’s largest ever, unifies the second and third largest brokers globally into a company worth almost $80 billion, overtaking market leader Marsh \u0026 McLennan Companies Inc (MMC.N). It comes at a time when insurers are facing rising claims and new threats from the global outbreak of coronavirus and climate change. Aon had scrapped plans last year to pursue a merger with Willis, a day after media reports forced it to reveal it was in the early stages of considering an all-stock offer for the Irish-domiciled company. The merger agreement came right after a 12-month restriction under Irish rules for revisiting the deal expired. The timing also coincides with a violent market correction, as Wall Street’s main stock indexes plummeted and the Dow Jones Industrials crashed 2,000 points on Monday, driven by 20% slump in oil prices and the rapid spread of coronavirus. This also weighed on Aon, whose shares dropped 16% on Monday, much more than the 8% drop in Willis shares.   When asked about the timing of the deal, Aon Chief Executive Officer Greg Case told Reuters: “This is the time we move,” noting that he spoke to 250 senior colleagues on Monday who were “energized” by the deal.  “In a world of volatility, clients have needs around protecting assets,” Case said. Willis shareholders will receive 1.08 Aon shares for each of their shares. The offer represents a premium of 16% to Willis’ closing price on Friday. Aon shareholders will own about 63% and Willis investors about 37% of the combined company. The deal is expected to add to Aon’s adjusted earnings per share in the first full year, with full savings of $800 million achieved in the third year. Aon will keep headquarters in London and be led by Aon CEO Case and Aon CFO Christa Davies. Willis CEO John Haley will become executive chairman. Aon and Willis put together insurance contracts for clients that involve a number of insurance providers, for anything from airlines to large sporting events. Brokers also play a key deal-making role in the 330-year-old Lloyd’s of London [SOLYD.UL] commercial insurance market, which carries out much of its business face-to-face and insures specialist risks like oil rigs and soccer stars’ legs. Aon and Willis also provide investment and employee benefits advice, and broker deals for reinsurers, who share part of insurers’ exposure to potential large losses like hurricanes, in return for part of the premium. The combined entity will work across risk, retirement and health businesses. The deal will also allow the “new” Aon to offer clients services in areas like cyber, intellectual property and climate risk, executives said.      Interactive graphic on insurance deals tmsnrt.rs/2IJODcx  (GRAPHIC: Aon and Willis agree largest ever insurance merger - here)     SECOND TIME LUCKY? The deal follows Marsh’s purchase last April of British rival Jardine Lloyd Thompson for $5.7 billion. “The insurers and re-insurers are unlikely to be happy about the deal given the scale of the two players coming together,” said analyst Ben Cohen at Investec. The deal terms state Aon must pay $1 billion to Willis if the deal falls through. Aon’s Davies said she was confident of getting all the necessary approvals for the deal. “We have had great counsel on the topic of anti-trust, feel really good about it,” Case said. Credit Suisse advised Aon, while Willis was advised by Goldman Sachs.

    "Title": "CP Group's $10 billion Tesco deal to test mettle of Thailand's new antitrust watchdog",
    "Content": "BANGKOK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - CP Group’s $10 billion deal to buy Tesco PLC’s (TSCO.L) 2,000 Thai retail outlets marks the end of a three-way tycoon tussle - and the beginning of the first engagement for Thailand’s newly powerful antitrust watchdog. A worker stands at the Tesco Lotus retail shop in Bangkok, Thailand, January 18, 2020. Picture taken January 18, 2020. REUTERS/Chayut SetboonsarngThe British grocery chain on Monday chose Dhanin Chearavanont’s operator of 12,000 7-Eleven convenience stores over the Chirathivat family’s Central Group of Companies Ltd - Thailand’s biggest retailer by market capitalisation - and beer magnate Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi’s TCC Group Co Ltd, said people with direct knowledge of the matter. Interest from the tycoons and their overlapping businesses in a deal only flagged in December has already drawn what sources said was the Thai watchdog’s first pre-transaction warning about antitrust compliance. The Office of Trade Competition Commission (OTCC) found its voice after becoming independent under new laws in 2017 with a mandate to block transactions that would create monopolies, at a time of increased public scrutiny of tycoons’ business empires. The first deal the watchdog has to rule on is the country’s largest, topping when Charoen Pokphand Group Co Ltd (CP Group) paid $9.4 billion for a minority stake in Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (601318.SS) (2318.HK) in 2012, Refinitiv data showed. “The transaction pits one of the most influential family conglomerates against a newly empowered regulator,” said Ben Kiatkwankul, partner at consultancy Maverick Consulting Group. “The asset’s size and increasing public sentiment versus tycoon dominance in the economy will make the OTCC’s task challenging.” CP Group runs its 12,000 7-Eleven convenience stores through CP All PCL (CPALL.BK) and about 80 cash-and-carry stores under Siam Makro PCL (MAKRO.BK). The firm on Monday said, upon antitrust approval, the deal will give it “a complementary retail business ... and enable the company to operate a wider range of outlets.” It will gain control of 1,965 stores Tesco operates in Thailand - much of which the British firm bought from CP Group during the 1997-8 Asian financial crisis. Included are 200 Tesco Lotus hypermarkets and 1,600 Tesco Lotus Express convenience stores. It will also buy 74 outlets in Malaysia. The OTCC is awaiting CP Group’s request for merger approval to study the impact on the economy, market competition and consumers, Somsak Kiatchailak, secretary-general of the OTCC, said on Monday. The commission will consider whether to approve, reject or approve the merger with conditions within 90 days of the request, he said.   OTCC Chairman Sakon Varunyuwatana previously told Reuters the watchdog had set up a committee to rule on the deal and that it was able to provide a preliminary review of each proposed Tesco bid upon suitor request - though none had been received. “We are ready with a committee and have mapped out several scenarios,” Sakon said. “The committee is comprised of economists, academics related to the retail business, competition law experts and our own officers and experts.” “We can tap into information across other agencies to support our investigation,” he said. Under the 2017 law, proposed mergers that could lead to market dominance or monopoly must be reviewed by the OTCC committee, which approves or rejects the proposal based on business necessity and its impact on consumers and the economy. Dominance is defined as having a market share of over 50%, or 75% when combined with two peers. “The question is how antitrust is defined,” said a banker familiar with the deal. “Will 7-Eleven stores be included to calculate market share?” In 2018, the energy regulator blocked Global Power Synergy PCL’s (GPSC.BK) proposed $4 billion merger with Glow Energy PCL over monopoly concerns regarding industrial estates. It finally approved the deal on condition Glow sold a power provider. The likely outcome for the Tesco deal is regulatory approval with broad conditions - and with a very public explanation, said Jirapong Sriwat, Partner at Nishimura \u0026 Asahi (Thailand). “The Thai public is not afraid to express strong opinions towards tycoons. These views have been echoed in parliament and could gain momentum in other industries,” said Kiatkwankul. “The OTCC’s mandate is to protect public interest and market competition and so it will have to set a clear precedence.” Reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng in Bangkok and Anshuman Daga in Singapore; Editing by Christopher Cushing and Mark PotterOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Tesco plans $6.6 billion shareholder return from Asia disposals",
    "Content": "LONDON/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Tesco (TSCO.L) plans to return $6.6 billion to shareholders after agreeing to sell its supermarket businesses in Thailand and Malaysia to Charoen Pokphand Group as part of plans to refocus on Britain. An entrance of Tesco Lotus retail shop is seen in Bangkok, Thailand March 9, 2020. REUTERS/Chalinee ThirasupaHaving withdrawn from South Korea in 2015, Britain’s biggest retailer began a review of its remaining Asian businesses last year in a further retreat from its global ambitions. The sale of its Thai and Malaysian businesses for an enterprise value of $10.6 billion comes more than five years into a recovery plan launched by Chief Executive Dave Lewis after an accounting scandal and dramatic trading downturn.  Lewis declared Tesco’s turnaround complete last October and will step down in October this year, when he will be succeeded by Ken Murphy, formerly of Walgreens Boots Alliance. Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne on Monday said that Tesco had secured “a very strong valuation” for the Thai and Malaysian assets and investors could look forward to a special dividend representing 21% of the group’s current market capitalisation. The price for the businesses, including debt, implies an enterprise value multiple of 12.5 time core earnings. After completion of the disposal to the Thai group controlled by Dhanin Chearavanont, Tesco intends to return cash to shareholders via a special dividend with an associated share consolidation. It will also inject 2.5 billion pounds ($3.28  billion) into its pension fund. Reuters reported on Sunday that CP Group was the frontrunner to buy the assets. Tesco shares were down 1.3% at 1249 GMT, outperforming the blue-chip FTSE 100 index, which fell 6.9% on coronavirus fears. Related CoverageCP Group's $10 billion Tesco deal to test mettle of Thailand's new antitrust watchdog“The coronavirus outbreak won’t stop people from eating: on the contrary, food-at-home will get a boost at the cost of food-out-of-home,” said Monteyne. REGULATORY SCRUTINY The deal is conditional on the approval of Tesco’s shareholders and regulatory approvals in Thailand and Malaysia, which is expected during the second half of 2020. However, CP Group will face a newly empowered Thai antitrust regulator, which could block the transaction if it finds that the deal would create a monopoly or market dominance, lawyers and analysts said. CP Group is buying Tesco’s assets through its CP Foods (CPF.BK) and CP ALL (CPALL.BK) businesses. “We believe the reason management has broken down the investment into small pieces is that it does not have to pass a shareholder vote and to minimise capital-raising risk as much as possible,” Citi analysts said in a report. CP Group runs its 12,000 7-Eleven convenience stores through CP All and about 80 cash-and-carry stores under Siam Makro. (MAKRO.BK)    It will gain control of the 1,965 stores Tesco operates in Thailand - much of which the British retailer bought from CP Group during the 1997-8 Asian financial crisis - including 200 Tesco Lotus hypermarkets and 1,600 Tesco Lotus Express convenience stores, plus 74 outlets in Malaysia. Chearavanont, senior chairman of CP Group, has repeatedly said he wanted to buy back the company. Tesco completed its exit from China last month with the 275 million pound sale of its joint venture stake to state-run partner China Resources Holdings (CRH). Slideshow (3 Images)Completion of the deal for the Thai and Malaysian assets would increase speculation over the future of Tesco’s central European division, consisting of stores in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, which would be the group’s only remaining overseas supermarket operation apart from Ireland. Tesco was advised by Greenhill, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Barclays (BARC.L), while JPMorgan (JPM.N) and UBS (UBSG.S) were joint international advisers and financiers for CP Group. Siam Commercial Bank (SCB.BK) and advisory firm Quant Group also worked with CP Group on the deal.

    "Title": "India sets out Yes Bank rescue, State Bank of India to take 49% stake",
    "Content": "NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India laid out a rescue plan for Yes Bank (YESB.NS) on Friday under which State Bank of India (SBI.NS) will take a 49% stake in the troubled lender, which is struggling with bad loans. A man walks past a logo of State Bank of India outside a branch in New Delhi, February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/FilesIndian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the restructuring plan would be implemented within 30 days, adding the depth of the problems at the bank were still being assessed. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it had increased Yes Bank’s authorised share capital, paving the way for a cash injection after it failed in its months-long attempt to raise enough money to meet regulatory requirements. Based on details in the RBI’s statement, analysts calculated that SBI would invest some 25 billion rupees ($339 million).  RBI and SBI, the country’s largest lender, did not provide any clarity on the cash infusion or any detail on who would put in the additional funds required by Yes Bank, which has been trying to raise 100 billion rupees for months. Analysts said that the bank will have to raise much more capital and bring in more investors.  SBI will not be allowed to reduce its stake to below 26% for at least three years. All instruments issued by Yes Bank, which qualify as Additional Tier 1 capital will be written down permanently, according to the RBI’s plan. Friday’s rescue plan came less than 24 hours after the RBI took control of Yes Bank because of a serious deterioration in its financial position. The RBI’s shock move underscored the extent of government concern around contagion in the banking system if India’s fifth-largest private lender had collapsed. Shares in Yes Bank, which fell as much as 85%, closed 56% lower on Friday.

    "Title": "India's Yes Bank debacle jolts investors, customers and partners",
    "Content": "BENGALURU/MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Shares in India’s Yes Bank (YESB.NS) plunged on Friday as panicky depositors rushed to withdraw funds and payment partners faced outages after the banking regulator took control of the lender in a late-night move and limited withdrawals. A security guard stands outside a Yes Bank branch at its headquarters in Mumbai, January 17, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/FilesThe shock move by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) followed months of steady deterioration in the financial position of the country’s fifth-largest private lender and concerns over governance. As thousands of customers poured into overcrowded branches nationwide and scrambled to pull funds, tempers flared and police were deployed in some states to control crowds.  Many business owners feared the central bank’s move would sting their operations too as the lender, with 1,000 branches across India, has many commercial clients. “I will struggle to pay salaries to my staff, or pay any of my vendors, because of the restrictions,” said Chintan Patel, a building contractor in the western city of Ahmedabad.  Customers took to social media to vent about the lender’s online systems being down, preventing fund transfers. And payment apps, such as PhonePe, which use Yes Bank to process transactions, also faced extended outages.  In a tweet, Sameer Nigam, the head of PhonePe, which is now owned by Walmart Inc’s (WMT.N) Indian arm Flipkart, apologised to customers and said it hoped to go live again in a few hours. SHARE PRICE ROUT Shares of Yes Bank fell as much as 85% early on Friday, erasing more than $1 billion of market value, the biggest ever intra-day fall in an Indian blue-chip stock. The stock pared losses later in the day to close down 56% on the day.  (For timeline of events, please click on) “Effectively, Yes Bank should have no equity value left,” said Sandip Sabharwal, a Mumbai-based fund manager. “Ideally, trading should be suspended until a formal restructuring.” The Yes Bank rout sent the broader market into a tailspin. As global markets reeled from the coronavirus, India's debacle sent the NSE Nifty 50 .NSEI tumbling as much as 3.9% to its lowest since last September. It later pared losses to close down 2.5%, while the Nifty Bank Index  closed 3.5% lower on the day. The RBI placed Yes Bank under a moratorium on Thursday and said it would swiftly work on a revival plan. On Friday it said State Bank of India (SBI.NS) would pick up a 49% stake. Shares in SBI, the largest state-run lender, also tumbled as much as 12% on Friday - its biggest intraday drop since October 2012. The stock closed down 6.2% on Friday.   “WHO CAN YOU TRUST?” Yes Bank, struggling under a growing pile of bad debt, has battled for months to raise the capital it needs to stay above regulatory requirements. Since late last year, it had been trying to raise $2 billion, and in February delayed its quarterly results.     Yes Bank is the third major financial institution to unravel in the last six months, following the RBI’s moves to take control of Dewan Housing Finance Corp (DWNH.NS) and Punjab \u0026 Maharashtra Co-operative Bank.  India’s opposition Congress party hammered the government for the failures, and said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was “bereft of ideas on how to fix the economy.” Sitharaman in turn said most of the banking system’s woes began during Congress’ tenure.  “I want to assure every depositor that their money will be safe,” she said. “The steps taken have been taken are in the interest of the depositors, the bank and the economy.” Related CoverageIndia sets out Yes Bank rescue, State Bank of India to take 49% stakeTimeline: India central bank takes control of bad loan-burdened Yes BankHowever, the RBI’s restriction on withdrawals while a rescue plan was being worked on left many depositors distraught. Anupam Varghese, who runs a start-up in India’s tech hub of Bengaluru, said he felt fortunate as he withdrew most of his money in advance, but he said the experience left him troubled. “If you can’t trust your bank, who can you trust?” he said. “I should be worrying about other things – my business, my work, not this.”  Additional reporting by Mumbai, New Delhi and Bengaluru newsrooms; Writing by Euan Rocha; Editing by Uttaresh.V, Clarence Fernandez and Andrew CawthorneOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File PhotoRUEIL-MALMAISON, France (Reuters) - Peugeot boss Carlos Tavares said on Friday PSA and Fiat Chrysler (FCA) will need to review their strategy in China in order to boost sales after the closing of the merger between the two groups. PSA and FCA are hoping to finalise a $50 billion merger in early 2021 that would create the fourth-biggest car maker in the world. “We are in China to stay, we need to find a formula in order to succeed,” Tavares said. Car sales of PSA in China have dropped by 55% to 117,084 units in 2019 due to fierce competition from local rivals. Its production site in the country is tailored to produce 1 million cars per year. FCA has a co-enterprise with Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) (601238.SS) in China, which has a 0.35% market share for passenger cars. FCA Group vehicles’ sales in China were down to 90,000 in 2019 from 163,000 in 2018, according to its annual report.

    "Title": "HP rejects Xerox's raised takeover offer of $35 billion",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - HP Inc (HPQ.N) on Thursday rejected Xerox Holdings Corp’s (XRX.N) raised takeover bid of about $35 billion, saying it undervalued the personal computer maker. The U.S. printer maker last month increased its offer by $2 to $24 per share, after its previous buyout offers were rejected by the PC maker for the same reason. Chip Bergh, chair of HP’s board, said the offer would leave shareholders with an investment in a combined company that is burdened with an irresponsible level of debt. “(It) would subsequently require unrealistic, unachievable synergies that would jeopardize the entire company,” Bergh said in a statement. He pointed to declining sales at Xerox and said its recent sale of its interest in the Fuji-Xerox joint venture raised concerns about the company’s future position. Xerox decided here to sell its 25% stake in Fuji Xerox, its joint venture with Fujifilm Holdings (4901.T), for $2.3 billion in November last year, following investor activism that scuppered a deal between the two companies. After Xerox raised its bid last month, HP said it would implement a poison pill plan to stop investors from amassing more than 20% stake in the company. HP on Thursday requested shareholders to reject Xerox’s tender offer launched earlier this week, saying it would disproportionately benefit Xerox shareholders relative to HP shareholders. Xerox shares fell over 4% and HP shares about 1% in early trading.

    "Title": "ProSieben's $500 million dating bet a turn-off for investors",
    "Content": "BERLIN (Reuters) - ProSiebenSat.1 Media (PSMGn.DE) has staked a $500 million bet on romance by buying U.S. dating app developer Meet Group Inc (MEET.O), but the deal was a turn-off for investors who sent the German broadcaster’s shares down as much as 10% to a decade low. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Germany's biggest commercial broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG. February 26, 2014.   REUTERS/Michaela RehleProSieben and General Atlantic, the minority partner in its e-commerce joint venture NuCom, jointly offered $6.30 per share in cash for Meet Group in the agreed transaction. Reuters first reported the news late on Wednesday. The deal, the boldest move yet by CEO Max Conze to escape a downward slide in ProSieben’s core commercial TV franchise, foresees folding Meet Group into NuCom’s own dating business, Parship Group, with a view to a possible listing in 2022. “The combination...is a unique value-creation opportunity for us,” Conze told Reuters in an interview. “At a stroke you are creating a top-3 global player, while the portfolio has huge synergy potential.” Yet the deal came as ProSieben reported weak 2019 results and set a cautious outlook that does not yet take into account the coronavirus epidemic that led British peer ITV (ITV.L) to warn of a 10% short-term hit to ad revenues. Analysts expressed concern that the Meet Group deal and risks to profitability could further strain ProSieben’s capacity to support a debt burden that, at 2.6 times core earnings, is already outside management’s target range. “This will increase pressure on the group to consider asset sales but at this point there is no mention of it and the Meet acquisition will increase leverage risk in the near-term,” Citi analysts said in a note. Responding to those concerns, Conze said he took leverage very seriously and he was committed to compensating the cash outflow for Meet Group with other “portfolio movements” during the course of 2020. Italy’s Mediaset (MS.MI), which has amassed a 15% stake in ProSieben as part of a wider push to bring about broader TV industry consolidation in Europe, declined to comment. RISK SHARING Although ProSieben owns 75% of NuCom and General Atlantic 25%, the Meet Group deal was structured so that ProSieben actually committed less cash than General Atlantic to the takeover.  As a result, ProSieben would own just 55% of the merged dating business - a structure that Conze said reflected caution on how he commits the company’s cash. The Meet Group transaction is expected to close in the second half of the year, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, and be accretive to net income in the first year. ProSieben’s shares have fallen by more than a third over the past 12 months, cutting its market capitalisation to $2.7 billion and raising doubts over whether Conze’s pivot to digital can boost not only the top but also the bottom line. In another sign of financial strain, management proposed a cut in the 2019 dividend to 0.85 euros, down from 1.19 euros the year before. At Thursday’s share price of 10 euros, that represents a yield of more than 8%.  ProSieben forecast that revenues would grow by 4% this year while adjusted EBITDA would be flat, reflecting the squeeze on profitability from its push into lower-margin digital projects as its commercial TV cash cow declines.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo(Reuters) - Office management platform Eden said on Tuesday it has acquired shared workplace operator WeWork’s Managed by Q for an undisclosed sum. The sale of another non-core business at WeWork comes as the operator presses ahead with hiving off non-core assets to chart a path to profitability. (reut.rs/32XHEGd) WeWork, which has been losing money, is under pressure to cut costs after it recorded a spectacular plunge in valuation to less than $8 billion from $47 billion last year, which in turn derailed its initial public offering.  The sale of Managed by Q is part of a series of steps taken by WeWork recently to turn itself around, including naming real estate veteran Sandeep Mathrani as Chief Executive and putting in place a second rung of leaders. WeWork bought Managed by Q in April last year for $220 million in cash and stock, a few months before its IPO imploded. Both Managed by Q and Eden run software platforms that allow managers to contract out services such as cleaning, handymen, and tech support.  Managed by Q, along with their existing clients and vendors, will be funneled into Eden.

REUTERS/Johanna GeronBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany’s Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) threw its weight behind a proposed $4.2 billion takeover of Embraer’s commercial aircraft activities by Boeing (BA.N), saying it would preserve a level playing field. “We would rather have two healthy competitors,” Lufthansa Group Chief Executive Carsten Spohr told an aviation conference on Tuesday. The deal would see Embraer cede 80% of its commercial arm to Boeing, but has been slowed by a European Union competition probe expected to last until the end of April. The EU is worried that whirlwind consolidation triggered first by Canadian Bombardier’s decision to exit the market by selling a key program to Airbus(AIR.PA), and then the integration of rival Embraer into Boeing, would leave too little choice. But several airlines have backed the Boeing-Embraer deal, suggesting Brazil’s Embraer would not remain viable as a standalone competitor to a combination of Europe’s Airbus and the Bombardier CSeries aircraft program, now renamed A220. Spohr said Lufthansa, which was the launch customer for the CSeries, had supported its takeover by Airbus after Bombardier ran short of funds needed to bring the 110-130-seat jet to market, and was now ready to back the Boeing-Embraer deal.

    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hudson’s Bay Co (HBC.TO) Chairman Richard Baker will take over as chief executive officer, the company said on Tuesday, after his bid to take the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue private was approved by shareholders. FILE PHOTO: A woman holds a Hudson's Bay shopping bag in front of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) flagship department store in Toronto January 27, 2014. REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File PhotoReuters reported earlier on Tuesday that Baker would take over from current CEO Helena Foulkes, according to a source familiar with the matter. Foulkes, who has been at the helm since 2018, will step down effective March 13, Hudson’s Bay said in a statement.  “The company and I are grateful for Helena’s leadership and significant accomplishments over the last two years,” Baker said in the statement. “We are confident in our go-forward leadership team and our ability to drive HBC forward.” The move comes just days after shareholders approved the Canadian department store operator’s move to go private in a C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) deal. Baker and his partners were in a tussle with the company’s top shareholders over the deal. The retail mogul had previously fallen short of necessary votes to win approval for his take-private quest, Reuters reported last year. He later won the support of a significant shareholder after raising the offer price to C$11 per share. The privatization deal was completed on Tuesday, the company said, and its common shares are expected to be delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange at the close of trading on March 4. “This is a great outcome for HBC and all of its stakeholders... It will take patient capital and a long-term view to fully unleash HBC’s potential at the intersection of real estate and retail,” said Baker. Hudson’s Bay has been shutting stores and selling assets as it sharpens its focus on luxury department store Saks Fifth Avenue and its namesake stores in Canada. Last year, the company announced the sale of its Lord + Taylor department store business to fashion rental service company Le Tote for about $100 million. It also sold its remaining stake in its German real estate venture last year for C$1.5 billion.

    "Title": "Thermo Fisher agrees to buy genetic tester Qiagen in $11.5 billion deal",
    "Content": "FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc (TMO.N) said on Tuesday it agreed to acquire German genetic testing company Qiagen NV (QIA.DE) (QGEN.N) in an $11.5 billion deal as the U.S.-based company looks to bolster its health diagnostic business. Qiagen, which has its main operations in Germany but is headquartered in the neighbouring Netherlands, is one of the world’s largest suppliers of products to prepare tissue and blood samples for advanced testing. These genetic tests play a major role in research and treatment of cancer, infectious diseases and genetic disorders. Last month it also began shipping a new rapid testing kit for the coronavirus to hospitals in China. The outbreak has claimed more than 3,000 lives and infected more than 90,000 people globally, after spreading from China to 77 other countries and territories At 39 euros per share, Thermo Fisher’s cash offer was accepted at a 23% premium to Qiagen’s closing price on Monday, Qiagen said, adding that the bid valued the company at 10.4 billion euros ($11.5 billion), including 1.26 billion euros in net debt. Qiagen shares rose 18% on the news to 37.5 euros, on track for their best daily gain in two decades.Thermo Fisher, which has a market valuation of around $120 billion, is the leading maker of instruments, software and other services for scientific research, including the vaccines and diagnostic tests now under development to combat coronavirus. Thermo Fisher fist approached Qiagen about a potential takeover last year, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the details are confidential.  In December, Qiagen ended the talks because it was not satisfied with the price offered and harbored concerns about the deal getting past antitrust regulators, one of the sources added.   Illustration of products are pictured from Qiagen, the diagnostics company which has agreed an $11.5 billion takeover deal with U.S-based Thermo Fisher in this picture illustration obtained by Reuters March 3, 2020. Qiagen/Handout via REUTERS  Marc Casper, Thermo Fisher’s chief executive officer, said that the instrumentation giant had long considered Qiagen a potential strategic partner. Qiagen’s coronavirus testing capabilities were not a significant part of the deal’s rationale, he added.”Deals happen when they happen,” Casper said in an interview. “When we got into the last few weeks, things really accelerated here. We were able to come to a price and deal terms that both companies felt are compelling.” Shares in Thermo Fisher rose 3.5% to $315.50 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal was the second to be announced this week in the healthcare sector, illustrating how some companies are braving the current market volatility to pursue deals. On Monday, Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) said it would buy smaller biotechnology company Forty Seven Inc (FTSV.O) for its research in immuno-oncology in a $4.9 billion deal.  QIAGEN’S TOUGH YEAR The acquisition of Qiagen, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021, will immediately add to Thermo Fisher’s earnings after the deal closes, the companies said. Thermo Fisher said the deal would generate $200 million in savings by three years after the deal’s close. Jefferies analysts said they had long viewed Qiagen’s strong position in research labs, plus front-end prep for molecular diagnostics as attractive to larger life science conglomerates. For Qiagen, the deal comes after a tumultuous few months. The company’s long-serving CEO Peer Schatz resigned in October when it announced a reversal of its strategy, saying it would stop developing its next-generation genome sequencing machines and instead collaborate with industry leader Illumina (ILMN.O). Slideshow (4 Images)JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) served as financial advisers to Thermo Fisher, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen \u0026 Katz provided legal counsel.

    "Title": "Xerox, HP blame each other as takeover battle heats up",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp took its $35 billion bid for HP Inc to the U.S. personal computer maker’s shareholders on Monday, with a formal tender offer and a rebuttal to HP’s account of why they could not negotiate a deal. FILE PHOTO: The company logo for Xerox is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 11, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid HP adopted a “poison pill” last month to neutralize Xerox’s tender offer. Unless the companies can reach a compromise, it will be Xerox’s bid to replace HP’s board of directors at the latter’s annual shareholder meeting in the next few weeks, rather than the tender offer, that will determine the outcome of the takeover battle.  The printing industry is in decline as companies and consumers turn to digital documents to save money and help the environment. This has put pressure on companies in the sector to consolidate and reverse revenue decline through acquisitions that can boost market share. However, after almost a year of on and off talks, HP and Xerox have been unable to avoid a confrontation.  HP accuses Xerox of refusing to provide it with enough information that would allow it to make an offer for Xerox. Xerox has said HP does not want to pursue a combination and that its bid for HP is the best way to combine the two companies and deliver a premium to HP shareholders. Complicating the talks is billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a top Xerox shareholder who last year also acquired a stake in HP, and has been pushing the companies to combine under the leadership of Xerox CEO John Visentin. Xerox’s account of their talks published on Monday also differed in some key points from a version that HP reported to its shareholders last week. For example, HP said last week that Xerox refused to address its questions about the trajectory of Xerox’s business during their negotiations last year. Xerox, on the other hand, said on Monday that few, if any, questions that HP raised were about the revenue trajectory. In another instance, HP said Visentin told its former CEO Dion Weisler that the debt an acquisition of HP would saddle Xerox with made it preferable for HP to buy Xerox. Xerox, however, said in its disclosures Visentin told Weisler that an acquisition of HP would be highly accretive for Xerox shareholders, despite the fact that a transaction in the opposite direction would be more straightforward. Xerox, whose $7 billion market capitalization is one quarter the size of HP’s, has said it expects a combination to yield approximately $2 billion in cost synergies, though HP has said this figure is too high. The two companies focus on complementary segments of the printing market. Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Edwina GibbsOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is seen at the company logistics center in Lauwin-Planque, northern France, December 30, 2019. Picture taken December 30, 2019. REUTERS/Pascal RossignolBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Amazon will on Thursday seek to overturn an EU order to repay about 250 million euros ($277 million) in back taxes to Luxembourg at Europe’s second-highest court, one of a series of high-profile cases marking the bloc’s crackdown on unfair tax deals.  The European Commission said in its 2017 ruling that the tax deal, which covered the period from May 2006 to June 2014, meant almost three-quarters of Amazon’s business went untaxed. The EU competition watchdog said the Grand Duchy allowed the U.S. online retailer to shift a significant portion of its profits from a subsidiary to a holding company without paying tax, giving the company an unfair advantage. At issue was the royalty paid by the subsidiary Amazon EU on certain intellectual property rights to Amazon Europe Holding Technologies, a company which the European Union said had no employees, no offices and no business activities. Amazon said in its filing to the General Court that the EU had not proven its case, which it claims is riddled with legal and factual errors. The hearing in Luxembourg, of case T-318/18, will run to Friday. The company said the EU ruling also breached principles of legal certainty, because it relied on a flawed reference framework.  It accused EU enforcers of discrimination by using 2017 OECD guidelines for a tax deal agreed with Luxembourg in 2003. In addition, Amazon said the EU has no case as the 10-year limitation period has expired. Apple, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Starbucks and scores of other multinationals have also been caught in the EU crackdown in recent years over their tax deals with countries in the bloc.  Starbucks won its fight in September last year after the General Court backed its arguments while Fiat Chrysler lost. Apple is still waiting for a ruling.

    "Title": "Gilead buys Forty Seven for $4.9 billion to bolster cancer drug pipeline",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) said on Monday it would buy Forty Seven Inc (FTSV.O) for $4.9 billion in cash, adding an experimental treatment that targets blood cancer to its portfolio of oncology drugs. FILE PHOTO: A Gilead Sciences, Inc. logo is seen outside the company headquarters in Foster City, California, U.S. May 1, 2018. REUTERS/Stephen LamShares of Forty Seven jumped 62%, trading slightly below the offer price of $95.50 per share. Gilead shares were up 2.3% at $70.95 in early morning trading. The deal is expected to complement the portfolio of Kite Pharma Inc, which the company acquired for $12 billion in 2017, and comes at a time when sales of Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs have seen a steep fall.  “The deal is in line with the strategy CEO Daniel O’Day had laid out earlier in the year, but I think he and his management need to do something more impactful,” Credit Suisse analyst Evan Seigerman told Reuters. Through the acquisition, Gilead will have access to Forty Seven’s lead drug, magrolimab, which switches off a “do not eat me” signal known as CD47 expressed by tumor cells that lets them avoid destruction. The drug is in early-stage testing. CD47 antibodies are a relatively new class of drugs in development for treating cancer, a lucrative but difficult market to enter for drugmakers.  Initially focused on treating blood cancers called myelodysplastic syndromes, magrolimab could be used alongside Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy Gilead gained through the Kite acquisition, in the future, Gilead executives said.  “There are studies ongoing and data being generated in DLBCL, and that’s one of those areas where I think you could imagine that there could be ... possibilities,” Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, is a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma that is currently being treated with Yescarta  and for which magrolimab is being tested as a treatment.    Gilead’s Yescarta, a CAR-T therapy added through the acquisition of Kite, has gained market share as a treatment for certain types of DLBCL, SunTrust analysts said on Thursday, citing a Bloomberg News report that Gilead had approached Forty Seven with a takeover offer. However, the market could in the future be split between treatments such as Forty Seven’s magrolimab and CAR-T therapies, according to SunTrust analysts Robyn Karnauskas and Asthika Goonewardene.

    "Content": "The logo of Jeju Air is seen at its office near Gimpo Airport in Seoul, South Korea, August 21, 2017.   REUTERS/Kim Hong-JiSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean budget carrier Jeju Air Co Ltd (089590.KS) said on Monday it would acquire a 51% stake in competitor Eastar Jet for 54.5 billion won ($45.49 million), a lower price than previously announced.  The acquisition is the latest case of restructuring in South Korea’s aviation industry, which is suffering losses from low travel demand due the coronavirus epidemic and a diplomatic feud between South Korea and Japan last year.  South Korea has the most virus infections outside China, with 4,212 as of Monday. The final acquisition price is lower than a preliminary deal price of about 69.5 billion won Jeju Air reported in a December regulatory filing, which was subject to change after due diligence. A Jeju Air spokesman declined comment on whether the change in the price was affected by the coronavirus epidemic or South Korean airlines’ current difficulties. Jeju Air said last month it was instituting unpaid leave for all employees due to shrinking travel demand, while Eastar Jet has said it will only pay 40% of executives’ and employees’ salaries in February, with the remainder to be paid at a later date. “The management is well aware that there is concern among our employees about the Eastar Jet acquisition,” Jeju Air CEO Lee Seok-joo said in a message to employees on Monday.  “However, the domestic airline industry, which has a structural problem of oversupply, will soon have to restructure... If it’s unavoidable, we believe it’s best to make a preemptive move.”  Jeju Air shares jumped as much as 21% after the announcement.

    "Content": "MILAN (Reuters) - Intesa Sanpaolo said on Friday it had hired JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS and local broker Equita SIM to complete a team of advisers led by Mediobanca supporting Italy’s biggest retail bank in its takeover offer of rival UBI Banca. FILE PHOTO: UBI Banca Popolare Commercio \u0026 Industria logo is seen in Milan, Italy, February 28, 2016.   REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File PhotoIntesa (ISP.MI) this month unveiled a surprise 4.9 billion euro ($5.3 billion) bid for smaller peer UBI Banca (UBI.MI), offering 1.7 new Intesa shares for each UBI share tendered to create the euro zone’s seventh-largest banking group with a focus on asset management and insurance. Intesa worked on the offer, the biggest European banking deal since the global financial crisis, with Milanese merchant bank Mediobanca, which remains its sole M\u0026A and lead financial adviser. Intesa beefed up its team of advisers after a cool reception for its offer from UBI’s board and the outright rejection by two groups of local shareholders holding roughly a combined 20% of the bank’s capital. A third group of Italian shareholders has yet to take a stance on the offer. A further rejection may complicate matters for Intesa, which has set a take-up threshold of two-thirds of UBI’s capital for its offer to be successful - though it reserves the right to lower it to 50% plus one share. UBI, which is working with Credit Suisse on possible defense strategies, is awaiting the publication of the offer prospectus, due to be filed with Italy’s market regulator by the end of next week, to have more detailed information. A person familiar with the matter said UBI was set to enlist Goldman Sachs alongside Credit Suisse as it seeks to fend Intesa off. Goldman declined to comment. UBI is also working with top Milanese legal firm BonelliErede, while Intesa’s legal adviser is Pedersoli. Intesa’s midnight blitz on UBI came only hours after Italy’s fifth-largest bank had presented its own business plan to 2022 to the market. As the strongest among Italian mid-sized banks, UBI has been tipped to play a prominent role in a long-awaited new round of mergers among second-tier lenders in the country. Sources have said the bank wants to retain an active role rather than becoming prey and is assessing potential alternative deals for which it would first need to seek shareholder approval.

    "Title": "Coronavirus outbreak rains on dealmakers' M\u0026A parade",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The steep market drop triggered by the global coronavirus outbreak has led many companies to hit the ‘pause’ button on mergers and acquisitions (M\u0026A), sabotaging the hopes of corporate advisers who expected a dealmaking bonanza this year.  FILE PHOTO: Passengers wearing masks are seen arrival at the Shanghai railway station in Shanghai, China, as the country is hit by an outbreak of a new coronavirus, February 27, 2020. REUTERS/Aly SongWhile M\u0026A volumes have not yet registered the effect of this week’s market volatility, dealmakers say some clients are stepping back from signing deals after the S\u0026P 500 Index dropped 11.5% from its all-time high in the last five days. “Volatility is bad for dealmaking,” said Alan Klein, co-head of M\u0026A at New York-based law firm Simpson Thacher. “It throws off your ability to appropriately gauge if it’s a good time to buy or a time to sell.” The global M\u0026A market is already set for its slowest first two months of a year since 2005, according to data provider Dealogic. Some dealmakers had been looking to 2020 to beat 2019 as the fourth strongest year for M\u0026A on record, even with the uncertainty of the presidential election in November. “I was ready to make the bold prediction that the total dollar volume of U.S. tech M\u0026A activity this year would exceed last year’s total. But the spread of the coronavirus has changed my thinking,” said Rick Climan, Silicon Valley-based M\u0026A partner at law firm Hogan Lovells.  To be sure, a few deals are still being done, especially ones that have long been in train, such as a 17.2-billion-euro deal for Thyssenkrupp AG’s (TKAG.DE) elevators division by a private equity consortium, and Intuit’s (INTU.O) $7.1 billion acquisition of personal finance portal Credit Karma, both of which were announced this week.  In addition, once the volatility subsides, advisers to companies expect many potential acquirers to seize on targets’ lower valuations and pursue their dream deals, particularly in sectors with frothy deal prices such as technology.       But for the moment many negotiations are under threat because acquisition targets are demanding that buyers value shares close to their 52-week highs, dealmakers say.  In the last 12 months, more than 60 percent of U.S. companies acquired at a valuation of more than $100 million agreed to deals that priced their shares above or at a discount of no more than 10% to their 52-week high, according to Refinitiv data.  “Companies’ 52-week high highs weren’t 50 weeks ago, it was last week. Ten days ago the market indices hit all-time highs. So to be down 10% from what was breathtaking levels has people understandably rattled,” Simpson Thacher’s Klein said. Dealmakers declined to give specific examples of negotiations falling through, citing confidentiality agreements.       (GRAPHIC: Premiums that U.S. takeover targets accepted - here )     Companies are also worried about the impact on earnings of the expected global economic slowdown due to the coronavirus outbreak, dealmakers said. If market disruptions continue, major private equity firms, which have built up big distressed debt funds in recent years, are ready to snap up assets on the cheap, senior executives said at an industry gathering this week. “We have a lot of clients that want to buy a number of companies, but they just can’t get comfortable with where valuations are,” said David King, co-head of technology M\u0026A at Bank of America.  “The type of market volatility that we’ve had of late could help ease some of that tension, to the extent that you still have a universe of acquirers that retains the confidence to go out and do deals,” King added.

    "Title": "London Stock Exchange on track to close Refinitiv deal as clearing jumps",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - - The London Stock Exchange Group (LSE.L) said on Friday it would complete its $27 billion takeover of analytics company Refinitiv on time this year as it reported a rise in annual income driven by a jump in clearing activity. The Refinitiv logo is seen on a screen in offices in Canary Wharf in London, Britain August 1, 2019. REUTERS/Toby MelvilleThe exchange’s chief executive David Schwimmer also said it was too early to assess the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on its global business, although like many companies it has imposed travel restrictions on some staff. Constructive “pre-notification” discussions with European Union competition regulators regarding the purchase of Refinitiv are underway, with Schwimmer saying he expects to submit a formal application in March for approval. There was nothing unexpected in the amount of time it was taking to obtain regulatory approval and detailed planning on integrating the two companies was underway, he added. “We remain on track to close the transaction in the second half of this year,” Schwimmer, the former Goldman Sachs veteran who took the reins at the LSE in 2018, said. Refinitiv is 45%-owned by Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO), which owns Reuters News. Schwimmer said it was premature to speculate whether the LSE may need to sell off parts of the group, such as the Milan Exchange, to win approval from Brussels. Rival Euronext has said it would be interested in bidding for it if so. “With respect to Borsa Italiana, it has been an integral part of the business... and there is no expectation or intention that any of that should change,” Schwimmer told reporters. (Graphic: LSE Group grows as London keeps clearing crown - here)     The exchange said total income from continuing operations rose 8% to 2.314 billion pounds ($3.01 billion) in the year ended Dec. 31, narrowly beating the 2.308 billion pounds expected by 13 analysts in a company supplied estimate. Total revenue also rose 8% to 2.07 billion pounds.  LSE shares were down 2.5% at 1003 GMT, but outperforming a 3.7% fall in the broader market .FTSE on jitters about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy. EURO CLEARING RESILENT The exchange’s post trade services unit, which includes clearer LCH and settlement and custody activities, reported a 15% rise in revenue. Growth at LCH comes as rival Eurex in Frankfurt says uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union is helping it to attract more euro clearing from London. LCH cleared swaps worth over a quadrillion dollars globally last year, though Schwimmer said he was aware there may be a “modest amount” of billions of euros moving to Frankfurt. “We continue to see growth in volumes coming out of EU domiciled customers... and very strong market share in that business,” Schwimmer said. FILE PHOTO: The London Stock Exchange Group offices are seen in the City of London, Britain, December 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File PhotoLCH will need EU permission to continue serving customers in the bloc from next January and Schwimmer said he expects to obtain this on a temporary or permanent basis this year. Talks on a broader UK-EU free trade deal start next week amid recriminations from both sides. Schwimmer also said the exchange expects its listings link to the Shanghai exchange “to take a while to build” up activity but it was in discussions with a number of companies.

    "Content": "(Reuters) - U.S.-based Public Storage (PSA.N) emerged on Friday as the likely buyer of Australia’s largest self-storage operator National Storage REIT (NSR.AX) with its current A$1.89 billion ($1.25 billion) offer, after two rivals dropped out of the race. Warburg Pincus had pulled out of the contest, National Storage said on Friday, a day after China’s Gaw Capital Partners’ also withdrew. Both private equity firms had offered A$2.20 for the Brisbane-based firm. Public Storage offered A$2.40 a share. All three parties had access to due diligence. Shares of National Storage fell as much as 6%, outpacing broader market losses of about 3%.   National Storage said Warburg Pincus reserved its right to revisit its decision.  Public Storage is still looking at National Storage’s books, the Australian company said, adding that investors should take no action at this point.  Gaw Capital’s approach was made public last month, while offers by Warburg Pincus and Public Storage were disclosed this month.

    "Title": "Thyssenkrupp sells elevator unit for $18.7 billion to Advent, Cinven consortium",
    "Content": "FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp AG (TKAG.DE) said on Thursday it agreed to sell its elevators division to a consortium of Advent, Cinven [CINV.UL] and Germany’s RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros ($18.7 billion) in what could be the world’s largest buyout this year. FILE PHOTO: A model of the MULTI elevator pictured inside Thyssenkrupp's elevator test tower in Rottweil, Germany, January 21, 2020. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/File PhotoThe bidding group prevailed against a rival consortium comprising Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N), Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which sources said submitted a lower offer. The deal, Europe’s biggest buyout since 2007, values the division at roughly 18 times core earnings, a person familiar with the matter said. It is expected to close at the end of the second quarter. The price beats the most optimistic estimates and roughly matches a bid that had been submitted earlier in the process by Finnish rival Kone (KNEBV.HE), which dropped out of the race earlier this month over expected antitrust risks. Thyssenkrupp said it would reinvest about 1.25 billion euros to take a stake in the unit, which, based on the purchase price, would result in a 7.3% share that would be used to partially fund its pension liabilities in a trust. “With the sale, we are paving the way for Thyssenkrupp to become successful. Not only have we obtained a very good selling price, we will also be able to complete the transaction quickly,” Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Martina Merz said in a statement. “It is now crucial for us to find the best possible balance for the use of the funds.” The decision followed a meeting of Thyssenkrupp’s management and supervisory boards, ending the closely watched saga. The group said it is aiming for an investment grade rating following the deal, while it is currently rated junk by credit agencies. Frankfurt-listed shares in the group (TKAG.F) closed 4.8% higher, with Jefferies analysts saying the price tag is impressive and should lead to a positive market reaction on Friday. By far the German conglomerate’s most profitable business, Thyssenkrupp Elevator is the world’s fourth-largest lift manufacturer behind United Technologies Corp’s (UTX.N) Otis, Switzerland’s Schindler (SCHP.S) and Kone. (For an interactive version of the graphic click here tmsnrt.rs/2ZlfocO?eikon=true) “Thyssenkrupp Elevator has established itself as a leading international group with a strong and cutting-edge product portfolio,” said Ranjan Sen, managing partner and head of Germany at Advent. Bruno Schick, partner and head of Germany, Austria, Switzerland and emerging Europe at Cinven, said the private equity owners intended to invest in the business to drive growth “both organically and via acquisition.” The auction leaves Thyssenkrupp with a much-needed cash injection at a time when the once mighty group has accumulated roughly 16 billion euros in debt and pension liabilities, more than twice its current market value. Pummelled by ill-fated investments, a downturn in the car market, multiple leadership changes and an overly complex group structure that was tackled too late, Thyssenkrupp’s shares trade around 13-year lows. “The board now has the task to quickly use the proceeds in a targeted way to make sure the company can develop successfully,” said the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation, Thyssenkrupp’s largest shareholder. “Thyssenkrupp must become competitive again and also regain its strength to pay dividends.” As part of the deal, Thyssenkrupp Elevator will remain based in Germany and equal representation between shareholders and labour representatives will be safeguarded. Jobs and sites will be secure until at least March 31, 2027, union IG Metall said. Thyssenkrupp will use the funds to cut debt, which will result in a significantly lower annual cash outflow for interest and pension payments, compensating for the loss of cash flow from the elevator business. Funds will also be used to support Thyssenkrupp’s other struggling divisions, including steel, plant building and car parts. The group will unveil exact plans for distribution in May. “Each of the businesses has the potential for a fast and fundamental improvement,” said Lars Foerberg, co-founder of Cevian Capital, Thyssenkrupp’s second-largest shareholder. “Now there needs to be full focus on making them operationally strong and fit for the future.”  ($1 = 0.9201 euro) Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Matthew LewisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Mike BlakeBERLIN (Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N) Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said the world’s biggest private equity firm cannot buy Bloomberg should it come up for sale as long as the firm owns competitor Refinitiv. Schwarzman said that he did consider such an investment on reading the news that Mike Bloomberg would put his financial news and data provider up for sale if he became president of the United States. “I wondered whether I should buy the firm, but I then I thought as long as we own Refinitiv, which is their competitor, we can’t,” he said at the SuperReturn private equity conference in Berlin.  Blackstone bought a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters’s data division in 2018, renamed later as Refinitiv, valuing the firm at $20 billion and making it the private equity firm’s biggest bet since the 2008 financial crisis. The London Stock Exchange last year agreed to buy Refinitiv in an all-share deal valued at $27 billion including debt. Blackstone will retain a minority stake.  Schwarzman offered to buy a stake in Bloomberg back in 1988, but was ultimately thwarted by Mike Bloomberg’s stipulation that he should never sell the stake and stay a partner for life.

    "Title": "Thai tycoons in fray as Tesco sets bid deadline for $9 billion Asia business: sources",
    "Content": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - British retailer Tesco (TSCO.L) has asked bidders to submit binding offers for its Asian business by Friday, in a deal that will see Thai billionaires fight for an asset valued at up to $9 billion, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. FILE PHOTO: FILE PHOTO: A company logo is pictured outside a Tesco  supermarket in Altrincham northern England, April 16, 2016. REUTERS/Phil Noble/File PhotoThe bidding is shaping up as a battle between Dhanin Chearavanont’s Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group, Central Group, controlled by the Chirathivat family, and beer-and-property magnate Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi’s TCC Group, they said. Tesco’s Asian operations comprise some 2,000 supermarket outlets and convenience stores in Thailand, where it is one of the biggest retail players, and 74 stores in Malaysia. “This is a very competitive process pursued by serious bidders. Looking at the deal size and financing perspective, most large banks are involved,” said one banking source who did not want be identified as the information is confidential. Antitrust concerns could pose a challenge to some bidders as Thailand’s antitrust office said last month that the deal should not violate anti-monopoly laws. Tesco will review the bids and is set take a decision next month, the sources said. The three Thai groups did not immediately respond to a Reuters query. There was also no response from Tesco, outside office hours. Britain’s biggest retailer said in December it started a review of its Asian operations, made up mainly of the Thai and Malaysian operations, after receiving interest. In the six months to Aug. 24, Tesco’s Thai and Malaysian  businesses together generated sales of 2.56 billion pounds  ($3.3 billion) and operating profit of 171 million pounds. The sources said that though the tycoons are taking a long-term view of Tesco’s Thai business, their bids are likely to factor in the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, which has curbed near-term growth estimates for the country. Regionally, Thailand is considered one of the most vulnerable economies to the virus outbreak due to its heavy reliance on Chinese tourists and China trade. Still, Tesco’s business offers bidders a chance to scale up their portfolio significantly. “How often do you get these assets in Thailand? And financing is so cheap,” said another source. For Central Group, Tesco’s stores would bulk up its supermarkets and convenience business, while offering CP Group a chance to buy back the supermarket chain it sold to Tesco during the Asian 1997/98 financial crisis. CP owns cash-and-carry Siam Makro (MAKRO.BK), which operates some 130 stores and over 10,000 7-Eleven convenience stores under CP ALL (CPALL.BK). Sirivadhanabhakdi’s TCC Group, through Berli Jucker  (BJC.BK), already owns the country’s second-largest hypermarket operator Big C Supercenter.  Tesco completed this week its exit from China with the 275 million pound sale of its joint venture stake to state-run partner China Resources Holdings.

There is no truth to the report, a source close to the company said, while Nokia declined to comment. (bloom.bg/3a1uMAW) The company, which competes with Ericsson and Huawei [HWT.UL] for 5G network equipment, said in February it expects intense competition to continue in 2020, as rivals seek to grab market share. 5G networks are at the center of a brewing technology war between United States and China, as they are expected to host critical functions including driverless vehicles, smart electric grids and military communications. Earlier this month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said the United States and its allies should consider investing in Nokia and Ericsson to counter Huawei’s dominance in 5G technology.

    "Title": "Aston Martin investor blazes green trail for buyout fund",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - The top shareholder of carmaker Aston Martin is on a mission to turn investments from theme parks to high-end furniture brands “carbon positive” by the end of 2020, as buyout funds battle to woo investors increasingly focused on tackling global warming. FILE PHOTO: Italian businessman Andrea Bonomi speaks during a press briefing in Paris December 5, 2014. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File PhotoInvestindustrial committed to a series of ambitious environmental, social and corporate (ESG) goals when raising its seventh 3.75 billion euro ($4.08 billion) fund last year. Chairman Andrea Bonomi, one of Italy’s most famous business magnates who set up the European buyout group in 1990, told Reuters the firm was on track to become carbon positive across all of its investments by the end of 2020 - meaning it will offset more than the carbon emissions of portfolio companies.  The firm wants 75% of electricity consumption across its investment portfolio to be sourced from renewable energy by 2020 and aims to hit 100% by 2027. “It has been a long journey. As a firm we became carbon neutral ten years ago but we didn’t stop there,” Bonomi said. “The ultimate goal is to raise the sustainability bar and cut fuel emissions across all our investments while keeping returns high. It is a tough balancing act as investors are no longer willing to accept returns at any cost.” While most buyout funds tend to showcase ESG credentials to their institutional investors - typically pension funds, insurers and family offices - there is no industry consensus on how to measure their progress. Investindustrial, which has Nordic funds among key investors including Denmark’s biggest pension provider ATP and Sweden’s AP2, has been working with the NYU Stern School of Business since 2016 to pilot a new system to track the financial benefits of ESG policies known as Return on Sustainability Investment (ROSI). “We have been very satisfied with Investindustrial’s way of incorporating ESG in their investments and they are without any doubt one of the funds in our portfolio which are among the best in that area,” managing partner at ATP Private Equity Partners, Torben Vangstrup, told Reuters. Since 2016, Investindustrial has pressured its portfolio companies to comply with the targets of the Paris climate agreement, urging them to switch to renewable energy, cut plastic consumption and improve recycled waste. For example, Spanish theme park operator Portaventura, which has been backed by Investindustrial for almost a decade, recently launched a 100,000 square meter photovoltaic site that provides about 40% of its overall electrical consumption. Aston Martin, meanwhile, has stepped up recycling efforts and is due to launch an all-electric version in 2025. Its newly-launched factory in Wales is fully powered by renewable energy. “Large buyout funds have been quick at building ESG teams but execution takes time. It took us five years to figure out how to bring down the carbon footprint across our funds,” Bonomi said. LEEWAY Investindustrial, which is invested in 20 companies primarily in Italy and Spain and ranks as one of southern Europe’s largest private equity groups, expects its offsetting measures to reach 2.6 million total carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) - a gauge of such activity - by the end of 2020. Its carbon reduction strategy partly relies on the development of a portfolio of nature conservation projects in countries including Guatemala and Canada. Bonomi has built a five-strong ESG team, led by sustainability head Serge Younes, to support Investindustrial in screening targets and oversee the implementation of eco-friendly policies. “Without ESG approval deals are not going through the investment committee,” the 55-year-old said. The New York-born businessman said its smaller size made it easier for Investindustrial to control ESG policy at its portfolio companies compared with heavyweight U.S. buyout funds. “Every time you invest in a company the CEO will tell you that he operates ‘within the law.’ But that’s not the point. Most companies have basic environmental policies in place,” said Bonomi. “What really matters is to make ESG an integral part of your decision-making process and drive returns in a sustainable manner.” ($1 = 0.9195 euros) Reporting by Pamela Barbaglia in London; additional reporting by Stine Jacobsen in Copenhagen; editing by Mark PotterOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Walmart in talks with possible buyers for Asda stake",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Walmart (WMT.N), the world’s largest retailer, is in talks with possible buyers of a stake in its British supermarket Asda, which it failed to combine with Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L) last year. FILE PHOTO: Walmart's logo is seen outside one of the stores ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. November 27, 2019. REUTERS/Kamil KrzaczynskiAsda and Walmart said in a joint statement on Wednesday that discussions with “a small number” of suitors followed “inbound interest” but no decisions had been taken. In common with its traditional big four British rivals - market leader Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury’s and Morrisons (MRW.L) - Asda has been losing market share to German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are still opening lots of new stores. That has put pressure on Asda, which said last week that budget-conscious British consumers were behind a fall in underlying sales in the key Christmas quarter. “We are currently considering whether there is an opportunity for a third party to invest in Asda, alongside Walmart, in order to support and accelerate the delivery of Asda’s strategy and position Asda for long term success,” Walmart and Asda said in a joint statement. The potential buyers share Walmart and Asda’s commitment to growing the British business, they added. Walmart would likely retain a significant minority stake in Asda in any deal, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Analysts said private equity firms are most likely to be interested in taking a stake in Asda, which Walmart bought for 6.7 billion pounds ($8.7 billion) in 1999. Walmart said it was considering a separate stock market listing for Asda in April after Britain’s competition regulator blocked Sainsbury’s attempt to buy the firm for 7.3 billion pounds and become the country’s biggest retailer,  Asda Chief Executive Roger Burnley told Reuters in July an initial public offering could happen in two years. In October, Asda agreed a 3.8 billion pound ‘buy in’ with Rothesay Life to secure the benefits for 12,300 members of one of its pension schemes, simplifying its balance sheet ahead of a possible standalone listing.     Walmart said on Wednesday an IPO remains an attractive long-term objective for Asda. “Asda is a great business with a clear strategy for the future and Walmart is committed to ensuring it has the resources and support it needs to deliver that strategy,” it said.     The U.S. retailer has focused on turning around its international business by targeting bigger and higher growth markets such as China and India and exiting or tying up with local players elsewhere.  It sold a majority stake in its Brazilian business and acquired a majority interest in Indian e-commerce company Flipkart in its biggest-ever deal in 2018.

    "Title": "Profit rise lifts Peugeot shares ahead of Fiat merger",
    "Content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Peugeot maker PSA Group said on Wednesday profitability reached a record high in 2019, results that contrasted with those of many rivals and boosted the group’s shares as it beds down a merger with Italy’s Fiat Chrysler.  The French firm, which also produces cars under the Citroen and DS brands, offset a slump in vehicle sales by selling pricier SUV models, helping to lift revenues. Operating margins grew to a record 8.5% last year thanks to cost savings.  Shares in the carmaker were up 6.6% at 1307 GMT, on course for their best day since October 2018 and making it the top performer on the CAC 40 .FCHI index of major French companies, as worries about the coronavirus market rattled stock markets.  A positive outlook from Moody’s on Wednesday added to PSA’s gains. The rating agency maintained its investment grade view on the company, citing healthy liquidity, and said the merger with Fiat Chrysler (FCA) (FCHA.MI) was positive.  Solid earnings from PSA and FCA earlier this month marked a rare bright spot in the car industry even as they faced hits like others from falling demand in markets like China.  Some rivals such as France’s Renault (RENA.PA) have struggled with sliding revenues and profits as well as lower cash flow generation, leading to ratings downgrades.  FCA, owner of brands like Jeep, did well in North America, which in a combined group with PSA would help balance the company’s portfolio. PSA is more exposed to Europe’s auto market, which it said would shrink 3% this year.  The two companies struck a deal in December to create the world’s No.4 carmaker, to cope better with market turmoil and the cost of making less-polluting vehicles.    FILE PHOTO: The logo of French car manufacturer Peugeot is seen at Brussels Motor Show, Belgium January 9, 2020. REUTERS/Francois LenoirPSA boss Carlos Tavares told a news conference the two groups were in good shape and said he did not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the merger, adding it had submitted 14 approval requests to competition authorities out of 24 it needs.  There are no immediate plans to change anything in the large portfolio of brands within the combined group, he added.    “We’ll decide with the people leading those brands what is the best way to go to market ... and reduce any cannibalization if there is any,” Tavares said. “I’m more excited by what we can do more of than less of.” CORONAVIRUS WEIGHS PSA has trimmed costs in areas such as procuring components as it has integrated its acquisition of Opel and Vauxhall. New launches of pricier models, including the Citroen C5 Aircross, helped lift revenues by a higher-than-expected 1% to 74.7 billion euros ($81.2 billion).   PSA’s group net profit increased 13.2% to a record 3.2 billion euros, and the company increased its dividend against 2019 results to 1.23 euros per share, up 58% from 2018 levels. The carmaker was “once again very solid”, analysts at brokerage Oddo-BHF said in a note, adding the results confirmed the company’s “best-in-class status.”  Slideshow (5 Images)But it still faces problems this year, including the coronavirus outbreak which has paralysed production in China and hits carmakers’ supply chain. PSA suffered 700 million euros in losses last year in China, where its car sales have tumbled and where it is exiting a joint venture with China’s Chongqing Changan Automobile (000625.SZ).  “In January, things were getting better (in Asia) until the coronavirus,” Tavares said, adding PSA planned an electric vehicle “offensive” in China, without giving details.

REUTERS/Rebecca CookDETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) Chief Executive Mike Manley received compensation of 13.28 million euros ($14.45 million) for 2019, in line with a target set by the company, the Italian-American automaker said in a filing on Tuesday. Compensation for Manley, who took over as head of FCA in July 2018 after the death of his predecessor Sergio Marchionne, included a base salary of 1.43 million euros for 2019, a bonus of 1.2 million euros and long-term incentives totaling 8.8 million euros, according to the regulatory filing. Last year, FCA set a compensation target for Manley of $14 million. Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot maker PSA (PEUP.PA) agreed in December to combine forces in a $50 billion deal to create the world’s No. 4 automaker, in response to slower global demand and mounting costs of making cleaner cars amid tighter emissions rules. The companies have not said what position Manley might hold in the newly combined automaker. Manley said in January that talks with PSA were progressing well and he hoped to complete the deal by early 2021.

    "Content": "SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - Southeast Asia’s Grab said Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) (8306.T) and IT services firm TIS Inc (3626.T) have agreed to invest a combined $856 million in the ride-hailing firm, as it seeks to expand aggressively into financial services. A Grab logo is pictured at the Money 20/20 Asia Fintech Trade Show in Singapore March 21, 2019. REUTERS/Anshuman DagaMUFG, Japan’s biggest bank by assets, has agreed to invest $706 million, the companies said in statements on Tuesday. “MUFG’s investment into Grab is a vote of confidence in our super app strategy and our ability to build a long-term, sustainable business,” Ming Maa, Grab’s president, said in a statement on Tuesday. Grab, backed by SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T), said it will use the funding to offer lending, insurance and wealth management products and services for Southeast Asian consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises. MUFG’s deputy president and incoming CEO Hironori Kamezawa said the bank will combine Grab’s advanced technologies and data management expertise with its financial experience. “We believe that this alliance will also generate additional momentum for our ongoing digital transformation of MUFG,” he said. Separately, Grab also said that TIS Inc, part of TIS INTEC Group, is investing $150 million in the company. Given a low interest rate environment at home, Japan’s MUFG has focused on boosting its Southeast Asian business by acquiring stakes in some of the lenders in the region. “Japan’s progress on the digitization of banking and other fintech lags that of other advanced countries,” S\u0026P Global Ratings associate director Shoki Nagano said in a report. “Banks must make sufficient investments in new technology, establish flexible and adaptive management suitable for fast-changing environments.” Grab and Indonesia-based rival Go-Jek are evolving from ride-hailing app operators to become one-stop shops for services as varied as payments, lending, food delivery, logistics and hotel bookings in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, Grab has teamed up with Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel) (STEL.SI) and applied for an online banking license in the country. On Monday, The Information reported that Grab and Gojek are discussing a merger. Gojek said in an emailed statement to Reuters that there are no plans for any sort of merger and recent media reports regarding discussions of such a nature are not accurate.

    "Title": "Defending against Xerox, HP doubles down on share buybacks, cost cuts",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - HP Inc (HPQ.N) said on Monday it would step up efforts to slash costs and buy back stock, as it seeks investor support to defend against a $35 billion takeover offer from U.S. printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp (XRX.N). FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the logo for HP Inc. at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., November 18, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo  GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEADThe announcement came after Xerox raised its cash-and-stock bid for HP earlier this month by $2 to $24 per share, ahead of a tender offer it plans to launch in early March. It is also asking HP shareholders to replace HP’s board directors with Xerox’s nominees at the company’s annual shareholder meeting later this year. On Monday, HP reported $14.6 billion in fourth-quarter revenue, slightly lower from last year, as growth in its personal computer business offset the continuous decline of the printing business. Adjusted earnings per share came in at 65 cents for the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ estimate of 54 cents, according to Refinitiv data.  HP said it would increase its share buyback program from $5 billion, announced last October, to $15 billion. It added that it was targeting $16 billion of capital to be returned to shareholders over the next three years, representing about half of its market capitalization. HP also said it expected about $650 million of cost savings to flow through its projected operating profit growth. It had previously announced a cost reduction program that it expects to result in $1.2 billion of gross, annualized run-rate structural cost savings in fiscal 2022, with additional ongoing productivity improvements of at least $1 billion.  HP raised its previous estimate of adjusted earnings per share to a range of $2.33 to $2.43 for fiscal 2020, and said it would deliver $3.25 to $3.65 in adjusted earnings by 2022.  Calling Xerox’s bid “flawed and irresponsible”, HP executives told Reuters there were many hurdles in a potential tie-up.  “It’s a combination of price, capital structure and an assessment of synergy,” Enrique Lores, who became HP’s chief executive officer in November, said in an interview.  HP said Xerox’s bid would burden the company with too much debt, and that Xerox overstated the expected synergies to be generated by cost reductions and productivity gains. However, it said it would reach out to Xerox to explore if a combination was worth pursuing. “We do believe in the industry consolidation. In fact, we led the consolidation of Samsung’s printing business a couple of years ago,” HP Chief Financial Officer Steve Fieler said in an interview.

    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of America (BAC.N) has appointed Jérôme Morisseau as its head of investment banking for France as it seeks to bolster its Paris franchise and win more business from large French clients, a memo seen by Reuters said. FILE PHOTO: A Bank of America logo is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., January 30, 2019. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File PhotoThe U.S. bank has also named veteran French banker Stéphane Courbon as chairman of corporate and investment banking for France. The appointments are part of a top level management reshuffle in Paris and follow the recent departures of senior deal-makers Bernard Mourad and Luigi Rizzo who used to head investment banking in France and EMEA, respectively. Bank of America established an 11,000 square metre office in Paris ahead of Brexit and will use it as a hub to serve clients across Europe after Britain’s transition period expires in December. The value of French mergers and acquisitions (M\u0026A) rose 2% last year to $193 billion, the third highest in the past decade, according to Refinitiv data. France has become a key battleground for both big investment banks and their boutique rivals.  The likes of Centerview and Evercore (EVR.N) have been looking to poach senior bankers in Paris who can boast long-standing relationships with the country’s major companies. At Bank of America, Courbon will work closely with the vice-chairman of investment banking for France, Laurent Vieillevigne, to further expand the bank’s client franchise, the memo said. Meanwhile the bank’s current head of EMEA corporate banking Fernando Vicario will take on an additional role as head of EU corporate and investment banking and will be based in Paris. In his expanded role, Vicario will report to Bruce Thompson, president of EU and Switzerland, and Jim O’Neil, head of EMEA corporate and investment banking. Vicario will keep his existing reporting lines into both O’Neil and the bank’s global corporate banking boss Anne Clarke Wolff for all matters related to corporate banking. Morisseau and Courbon will report to both Vicario and Matt Cannon, who heads Bank of America’s EMEA investment banking and recently replaced Luigi Rizzo.

REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File PhotoMILANO (Reuters) - A group of UBI Banca (UBI.MI) investors holding 1.6% of the Italian bank’s capital on Monday said a takeover offer by Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) significantly undervalues the stock. “The group’s steering committee has given a negative opinion to Intesa Sanpaolo’s proposal,” the shareholders, which call themselves ‘Patto dei Mille’, said in a statement. “The swap offer significantly underestimates the intrinsic value of UBI’s stock and does not adequately consider its earnings outlook.”  Intesa last week announced an all-paper offer to buy smaller peer UBI Banca as it seeks to create the euro zone’s seventh-largest bank by assets. The group of wealthy families and business owners from the northern town of Bergamo said the offer does not protect shareholders’ interest.

    "Title": "Hedge fund Third Point calls on Prudential to break up",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Hedge fund Third Point LLC amassed a more than $2 billion stake in Prudential Plc (PRU.L) and called on the British insurer on Monday to split into two companies. FILE PHOTO: The logo of British life insurer Prudential is seen on their building in London, Britain March 17, 2019. REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File PhotoThird Point’s demands, first reported by Reuters earlier on Monday, could lead to a major shake-up at Prudential, only a few months after it spun out its European insurance and asset management businesses into a new company called M\u0026G Plc (MNG.L). Third Point, which specializes in shareholder activism and is run by Daniel Loeb, wrote to the 332-year old London-based company on Monday to ask it to separate its Asian and U.S. businesses. The New York-based hedge fund said Prudential’s stock would benefit if it stopped running its crown jewel Asia business and its U.S. business, Jackson National Life, out of one holding company in Britain. Jackson accounts for a small portion of Prudential’s value, but is extremely complex to analyze, Third Point said. As a result, investors are undervaluing Prudential’s Asia business because they are bundling it with Jackson, Third Point added. Moreover, the current structure is putting Prudential at a disadvantage when it comes to recruiting top talent in Asia, according to Third Point. In the letter, addressed to Prudential’s board of directors, Third Point also blamed the company’s management for prioritizing dividend payouts over reinvesting in the business.  Third Point is arguing that some of the benefits of a split would include cost cuts at Prudential’s British holding company, better capital allocation policies, and better management of the U.S. and Asia businesses, the sources said. “If PruAsia and Jackson were separated, resulting in a greater focus on reinvesting capital in each unit and streamlining central costs at the group level, our analysis indicates that the interests represented by Prudential plc shares can double within three years,” Loeb wrote in the letter. Prudential confirmed in a separate statement that it had received a letter from Third Point and looked forward to commencing a dialogue with the hedge fund. While Prudential’s headquarters are in London, it is regulated in Hong Kong following its separation from M\u0026G. A source told Reuters earlier this month that Prudential was studying options to reduce its ownership in Jackson, including seeking “outside capital.” Third Point’s stake is equivalent to just under 5% ownership of Prudential, making the fund the company’s second-largest shareholder and Prudential the hedge fund’s biggest position currently, according to the sources. Prudential has a market capitalization of 36.8 billion pounds.  Third Point, which has $14 billion in assets under management, has experience in pushing companies to split themselves apart, including at Yum Brands, Dow Chemical and most recently United Technologies. To raise additional capital to build the stake in Prudential, Third Point raised a so-called special purpose vehicle, which allows hedge funds to raise money quickly and investors to put money to work in the stock of a specific company instead of a co-mingled fund. Although Third Point is based in the United States, a significant portion of its recent activist engagements have taken place overseas, at companies including Sony Corp (6758.T), Nestle (NESN.S) and EssilorLuxottica (ESLX.PA).

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A Bank of America logo is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., January 30, 2019. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File PhotoLONDON (Reuters) - Bank of America’s (BAC.N) seasoned deal-maker Wadih Boueiz has resigned after a career spanning 21 years, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Boueiz, 43, was in charge of the bank’s global sovereign wealth funds and public pensions division. Boueiz, known as Woody, started his career at Bank of America in New York in 1999 and then moved to London in 2007.  He made his name in the Middle East where he started working in 2011, advising the likes of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). In a memo seen by Reuters, the bank’s co-heads of global investment banking Jack MacDonald and Thomas Sheehan told staff that Boueiz had decided to pursue opportunities outside the firm. Boueiz was until last summer co-head of the bank’s corporate and investment banking business across the Middle East and North Africa with Hakim Karoui, focusing mostly on large investment banking clients, the source said. He represented Saudi Arabia’s Public investment Fund (PIF) on the $69 billion sale of its 70% stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) to oil giant Saudi Aramco. Boueiz also worked closely with ADNOC on the sale of a 49% stake in its oil pipelines business to an investment consortium comprising BlackRock and KKR. Bank of America declined to comment.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Germany's Stada buys 15 GSK consumer health brands",
    "Content": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Private equity-backed generic drugmaker Stada STAGn.D said it has agreed to buy 15 consumer healthcare products from British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) to further strengthen its prescription-free drugs business in Europe.     FILE PHOTO: The logo of Stada Arzneimittel AG is pictured at their headquarters in Bad Vilbel near Frankfurt, Germany, August 24, 2017.  REUTERS/Ralph OrlowskiThe brands - venous treatment Venoruton, Coldrex cold remedy, Cetebe vitamin C supplements, Mebucaine for sore throats and Tavegyl allergy relief, among others - are marketed in more than 40 countries including Germany, Russia, Poland and Spain. Stada agreed to pay more than 300 million euros ($325 million) according to two people familiar with the transaction. Stada and GSK declined to comment on the price. GSK, which has combined its over-the-counter (OTC) products unit with that of Pfizer, is focusing on brands with global or larger cross-border reach while Stada is keen to expand a portfolio of smaller, national products, spokesmen for the companies said. “Under our ownership, we believe there is an excellent opportunity to revitalize and grow these consumer healthcare brands,” Stada Chief Executive Peter Goldschmidt told Reuters. GSK said the deal counted towards its target of 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) of net proceeds from divestments of consumer products over the 2019-20 period, as laid out in December 2018 under a joint venture deal with Pfizer.     “This divestment signals the good progress we are making towards our target,” a GSK spokesman said.  Stada, majority owned by buyout firms Bain and Cinven since 2017, expects the transaction to close during the second quarter of this year.  Stada CEO Goldschmidt said last year the company would focus mainly on striking production and development deals with partners, rather than buying companies outright. Earlier this year, GSK launched a two-year program to split into two entities, separating the core prescription drugs and vaccines business from the enlarged over-the-counter products business. Having sold two travel vaccines to Bavarian Nordic (BAVA.CO) for up to 955 million euros in October, the British group is looking into divesting more pharmaceutical assets, starting with a review of its prescription dermatology business with about 200-300 million pounds in annual sales. The Stada deal echoes a similar transaction in June 2019, when the German group agreed to buy six Europe-focused consumer brands - including itch relief cream Eurax and Tixylix cough liquids - from GSK for an undisclosed price. Stada sells consumer healthcare products such as painkillers and sunscreen lotions as well as generic prescription drugs, which are cheaper copies of established pharmaceuticals that have lost patent protection. In November, Stada purchased over-the-counter and prescription drugs units from Japan’s largest drugmaker Takeda (4502.T) for $660 million, in the German group’s largest deal to date that boosted its Russian footprint.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Hotel Unizo, operated by Japanese hotel operator Unizo Holdings, is seen at the entrance of the hotel in Tokyo, Japan November 18, 2019.  REUTERS/Junko Fujita/File PhotoThe improved offer values the company at 205 billion yen, compared with Unizo’s market value of 200 billion yen as of Friday last week.  Unizo supports an offer from Lone Star, which has bid 5,700 yen per share. Lone Star’s bid is scheduled to expire on Friday.   “Blackstone believes that the revised Blackstone offer offers the best option, not only for Unizo’s shareholders, who will be allowed to maximise the value of their shares, but also for all Unizo employees,” Blackstone said in a statement.  Blackstone said it would only launch its bid if Unizo agrees with Blackstone’s conditions by April 30.     Unizo in July became the target of a hostile bid by Japanese travel agent H.I.S. Co (9603.T). Unizo at one stage turned to U.S. buyout firm Fortress Investment Group to fend off that bid. But it now opposes Fortress’s bid which stands at 5,200 yen per share. Blackstone emerged as a potential bidder in October. While Blackstone tried to win over Unizo management following its initial approach, Unizo turned to Lone Star.

    "Title": "Buffett defends Berkshire stock push, reassures on future as profit smashes record",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday forcefully defended Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) decision to invest heavily in stocks of companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) as he labors through a four-year drought since his last major acquisition of a company. Buffett, 89, also used his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders to assure they should not worry about the future of the company, which is “100% prepared” for when he and 96-year-old Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are no longer around. Berkshire also posted record full-year earnings of $81.42 billion, nearly twice the prior high from 2017, boosted by unrealized gains from its stock investments. Operating profit, however, fell 3% to $23.97 billion. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate ended the year with a $128 billion cash hoard, after repurchasing $2.2 billion of stock in the fourth quarter and $5 billion in 2019. “I do think it’s on the right path,” said James Armstrong, president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates in Pittsburgh, which invests one-fourth of its assets in Berkshire. “Its balance sheet is exactly the type of toolkit you’d like to leave a successor.” Berkshire has more than 90 units employing 391,539 people, including the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and See’s candies; clothing and jewelry companies, and namesake utility and real estate brokerage businesses. It also invests in such companies as American Express Co (AXP.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N). Berkshire ended the year with a $128 billion cash hoard, having made no major acquisitions since paying $32.1 billion in January 2016 for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts, and Buffett lamented his inability to find big companies to buy. “The opportunities to make major acquisitions possessing our required attributes are rare,” he wrote. Related CoverageRising stocks fuel record profit for Buffett's Berkshire; operating profit disappointsBuffett calls for more accountability for corporate directorsBuffett’s letters have grown shorter in recent years, with less humor and less discussion about the economy and investing. James Shanahan, an Edward Jones \u0026 Co analyst who rates Berkshire a \"buy,\" called Saturday's letter a missed opportunity to show how Berkshire, whose stock has trailed the Standard \u0026 Poor's 500 .SPX over the last decade, is undervalued. “It felt much more businesslike and detached, and lost some of the wisdom that made it so entertaining,” he said. AMERICAN TAILWIND REVISITED The record profit is largely the result of an accounting rule that Buffett urges investors to ignore, requiring Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income. Buffett, whose $90.2 billion net worth makes him the world’s fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine, said that while he still prefers buying whole companies, stocks are a better bet than low-yielding bonds. He attributed that in part to the “American Tailwind,” or the economy’s ability to grow despite roadblocks such as war, high inflation and financial panic. “If something close to current rates should prevail over the coming decades and if corporate tax rates also remain near the low level businesses now enjoy, it is almost certain that equities will over time perform far better than long-term, fixed-rate debt instruments,” he wrote. Buffett’s comments surprised Stephen Dodson, who manages the Bretton Fund, which owns Berkshire shares. FILE PHOTO: Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett walks through the exhibit hall as shareholders gather to hear from the billionaire investor at Berkshire Hathaway Inc's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., May 4, 2019.   REUTERS/Scott Morgan“I was expecting him to say the market was expensive,” Dodson said. “He didn’t even hint that.” The cash stake has nonetheless been a drag for investors. In 2019, Berkshire’s stock rose 11% while the S\u0026P 500 including dividends rose 31.5%, the biggest shortfall in a decade. SUCCESSION Buffett also used his letter to comfort investors that Berkshire will be in good hands after he leaves. In 2018, Berkshire promoted Greg Abel, 57, and Ajit Jain, 68, to vice chairmen, giving them oversight of Berkshire’s non-insurance and insurance operations, respectively, and freeing Buffett and Munger to focus on deploying capital. Buffett also has portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler helping him buy stocks. Combs, 49, on Jan. 1 also became Geico’s chief executive.  “Charlie and I long ago entered the urgent zone,” Buffett wrote. “That’s not exactly great news for us. But Berkshire shareholders need not worry: Your company is 100% prepared for our departure.” He also said shareholders will be able to ask Abel and Jain questions at Berkshire’s annual meeting on May 2, where Buffett and Munger normally do most of the talking. FILE PHOTO: Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett (left) and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are seen at the annual Berkshire shareholder shopping day in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., May 3, 2019.   REUTERS/Scott Morgan“I’m comfortable with how Berkshire is moving up the next generation,” said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo \u0026 Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, a longtime Berkshire shareholder. Buffett said his estate may need 12 to 15 years to dispose of his Berkshire stock, which is going to charities including the Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation, and Berkshire stock will be “a safe and rewarding investment” during that time. The disposal plan “gives investors the ability to focus on everything else,” said David Marcus, chief investment officer at Evermore Global Advisors, who personally owns Berkshire shares. “If Buffett weren’t the age that he is, it wouldn’t matter.” Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and David Randall in New York; Editing by Megan Davies, Frances Kerry and Franklin PaulOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Rising stocks fuel record profit for Buffett's Berkshire; operating profit disappoints",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Saturday posted a 23% decrease in quarterly operating profit, while soaring prices in stock holdings such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) enabled the conglomerate to smash its old record for full-year earnings. FILE PHOTO: Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett talks to reporters prior to the Berkshire annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska May 2, 2015.  REUTERS/Rick WilkingIn his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett defended Berkshire’s foray into stocks, which comes amid a four-year drought since its last major acquisition that has left Berkshire sitting on $128 billion of cash. Berkshire did step up repurchases of its own stock, buying back roughly $2.2 billion in the quarter. Repurchases totaled $5 billion for the full year. “I am delighted with the increased commitment to share repurchases,” said Thomas Russo, a partner at Gardner, Russo \u0026 Gardner, which invests $13 billion, of which 13% is in Berkshire. “It may be a very large arrow in Berkshire’s quiver to increase intrinsic value on a per-share basis.” Nonetheless, while the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units showed improvement, reinsurance operations weighed on operating results, and the Geico car insurer posted “subpar performance” as loss claims eclipsed premium growth, according to Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research. “The big miss was on the insurance front, though energy and railroads were stronger,” Seifert said. It will be interesting see the impact of coronavirus on freight traffic in the first quarter and beyond.” Fourth-quarter operating profit fell to $4.42 billion, or approximately $2,720 per Class A share, from $5.72 billion, or about $3,484 per share. Berkshire did not write down its 26.6% stake in Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), which is struggling to rebound from years of cost-cutting amid changing consumer tastes, though its market value is well below the $13.8 billion carrying cost on Berkshire’s balance sheet. Net income, reflecting stock gains, totaled $29.16 billion, compared with a net loss of $25.39 billion a year earlier. For all of 2019, net income totaled $81.42 billion, topping the record $44.94 billion for 2017, when Berkshire benefited from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate. Such huge swings stem from an accounting rule requiring Berkshire to report paper gains and losses from its stock holdings with net income. Buffett wrote that companies whose stocks Berkshire owns are generating returns that are “remarkable under any circumstances,” especially compared with returns on bonds. Apple soared 86% in 2019 and 31% in the fourth quarter alone, leaving Berkshire with a $73.7 billion year-end stake. Berkshire’s stock was a laggard in 2019, rising 11% compared with a 31.5% gain in the Standard \u0026 Poor’s 500 including dividends, in part reflecting the drag from the cash stake.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File PhotoBEIJING (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) has agreed to buy Chinese snack brand Be \u0026 Cheery from local jujube maker Haoxiangni Health Food Co Ltd (002582.SZ) for $705 million, the companies said. The U.S. multinational food and beverage maker said the acquisition of Be \u0026 Cheery, which sells snacks from nuts to dried fruits mainly on Chinese e-commerce platforms, was an important step in its goal to become China’s leading consumer-focused food and beverage company. “Be \u0026 Cheery adds direct-to-consumer capability, positioning us to capitalize on continued growth in e-commerce, and a local brand that is able to stretch across a broad portfolio of products, through both online and offline channels,” Ram Krishnan, CEO of PepsiCo Greater China, said in a statement on Sunday. “We also expect to leverage Be \u0026 Cheery’s innovation and consumer insights capabilities to drive innovation in other key PepsiCo growth markets.” Haoxiangni, which is based in the eastern city of Hangzhou, said in a separate filing that it had decided to sell as it wanted to focus on the jujube business.  Founded in 2003, Be \u0026 Cheery is one of the largest online snack companies in China and reported revenues of about 5 billion yuan ($711.7 million) in 2019, the companies said.  The transaction is subject to a Haoxiangni shareholder vote, certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions, they said.

    "Title": "Buffett calls for more accountability for corporate directors",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday called on corporate America to make their boards of directors more accountable to shareholders and less beholden to chief executive officers, perhaps by reducing their pay and requiring that they buy more stock. FILE PHOTO: Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett walks through the exhibit hall as shareholders gather to hear from the billionaire investor at Berkshire Hathaway Inc's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S., May 4, 2019. REUTERS/Scott MorganIn his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders, Buffett said pay for outside directors has “soared” to levels that might threaten their independence, sometimes reaching $250,000 to $300,000 for two weeks work, while “generous” age limits ensure “fabulous” job security. Buffett said this can make even “independent” directors resist challenging bad decisions by CEOs, especially in takeovers. “When seeking directors, CEOs don’t look for pit bulls,” Buffett wrote. “It’s the cocker spaniel that gets taken home.” He said one large American company he did not identify recently had eight directors who never bought its shares with their own money. “I feel better when directors of our portfolio companies have had the experience of purchasing shares with their savings, rather than simply having been the recipients of grants,” Buffett wrote. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units such as the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurer, and Dairy Queen ice cream. Its own 14-person board is no paragon of youth, with six directors — including the 89-year-old Buffett — over age 70 and three in their 90s. And the voting influence of most Berkshire directors is limited because Buffett, considered by many among the world’s greatest investors, controls nearly one-third of the voting power despite owning only about one-sixth of Berkshire’s stock. Still, no Berkshire director was paid more than $7,300 for their work at the company in 2018, a regulatory filing shows, though several including Buffett and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Bill Gates are billionaires, and can afford it. Buffett also said adding women to boards “remains a work in progress.” Three Berkshire directors are women. Buffett said he has been a director at 21 publicly-traded companies including Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Washington Post Co, and in all but two “represented a substantial holding of stock.” He has given up all directorships apart from Berkshire, one of several moves in recent years to reduce his workload.

Credit Karma, which is backed by funders including private-equity firm Silver Lake and financial-technology venture firm Ribbit Capital, declined to comment.

    "Content": "The company logo for Xerox is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 11, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid(Reuters) - Xerox Holdings Corp said on Friday it would continue to pursue HP Inc, even after the PC maker said it would implement a poison pill plan to shield itself against a takeover offer from the U.S. printer maker. “Despite the HP board’s intention to deny shareholders the chance to choose for themselves, we will press ahead with our previously announced tender offer and electing our slate of highly qualified director candidates,” Xerox said. It raised its offer earlier this month by $2 to $24 per share, following several rejections of its previous buyout offers by HP. HP on Thursday said the implementation of the stockholder rights plan, which has a one-year expiration period, aims to stop investors from amassing more than 20% stake in the company. That leaves Xerox with one realistic alternative for its takeover plans. It will have to go ahead with its plans to replace HP’s board with its own nominees in a shareholder vote during the latter’s upcoming annual meeting.  Xerox said in January it plans to nominate 11 independent candidates to HP’s board. HP did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.

    "Content": "(Reuters) - T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N) said on Thursday that they had agreed on new merger terms that would reduce the stake of major Sprint shareholder SoftBank, while leaving the offer to other shareholders unchanged. FILE PHOTO: Smartphones with the logos of T-Mobile and Sprint are seen in this illustration taken September 19, 2017. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationUnder the revised deal, SoftBank (9984.T) will hold about 24% of the combined entity, down from 27% under the earlier terms. T-Mobile’s parent Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) will hold about 43% of the combined entity, up from the 42% that the German group would have held.  Shares of Sprint were up 5% to $9.95, while T-Mobile fell 1.5% to $98 in trading after the bell. SoftBank has agreed to surrender about 48.8 million T-Mobile shares acquired in the merger to the new company after the deal closes, changing the exchange ratio to 11 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile share, higher than the originally agreed 9.75 shares. Sprint shareholders other than SoftBank will continue to receive the original exchange ratio. SoftBank can get the shares back if the combined company hits stock price milestones, the companies said without disclosing the details. Sources said SoftBank agreed to the change to avoid delaying the close of the merger. If the ratio for the Sprint common shareholders was changed, a new fairness opinion and a shareholder vote may have been required, which could have delayed the close by four months. The companies now hope to close on April 1. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.  Last week, a federal judge approved the merger deal, rejecting a claim by a group of states that said the proposed transaction would violate antitrust laws and raise prices. New York on Sunday dropped its fight against the merger of the U.S. wireless carriers, saying the state would not appeal the judge’s approval of the deal. Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges said on Wednesday the new T-Mobile would have a market value of around $120 billion. That compares with $274 billion for AT\u0026T (T.N) and $242 billion for Verizon (VZ.N).

    "Title": "Morgan Stanley's Gorman charts ambitious course with $13 billion E*Trade deal",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley said on Thursday it would buy discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp in a stock deal worth about $13 billion, the biggest acquisition by a Wall Street bank since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Part of a broader consolidation in the discount brokerage sector, the move will add breadth to Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit, a business that Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has been trying to build out to insulate the bank from weak periods for trading and investment banking. Morgan Stanley’s main rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, has also been forging ahead with an upstart retail bank, while others including Bank of America Corp and UBS are trying to focus on basic lending and wealth management services. “The addition of E*Trade’s products and iconic brand will serve as a leap forward” for the bank, Gorman said on a call with analysts. The deal reflects a more relaxed regulatory mood under President Donald Trump’s administration, which has helped unleash other big-ticket takeovers in the financial sector.  Big banks have been emboldened to do deals that would have been tricky for the Wall Street titans under President Barack Obama’s administration.  Related CoverageMorgan Stanley's E*Trade deal to test Washington's regulatory mood in election yearIn March last year, U.S. regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp’s purchase of smaller rival MB Financial Inc for $4.7 billion got a nod from regulators. It was followed by approval for a $28 billion marriage of BB\u0026T Corp and SunTrust. “We believe federal regulators are likely to approve Morgan Stanley’s acquisition of E*Trade though the review could take longer than realized as we expect the Federal Reserve to conduct a systemic risk review,” said Jaret Seiberg of Cowen Washington Research Group. Gorman sounded confident that the deal would go through without any regulatory hurdles. “We wouldn’t be entering into this (the deal) if we didn’t think from a regulatory perspective this would be viewed favorably,” said Gorman.  The U.S. Federal Reserve did not immediately comment on the deal. Banking deals in particular had languished after the financial crisis as strict capital and liquidity rules were imposed on lenders with more than $50 billion in assets, making it unattractive for mid-size firms to acquire more assets. FILE PHOTO: A sign is displayed on the Morgan Stanley building in New York U.S., July 16, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File PhotoTHIRD TIME LUCKY FOR GORMAN In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Gorman said he had attempted to buy E*Trade twice - in 2002 when he was at Merrill Lynch and then again in 2007 at Morgan Stanley - before re-initiating talks late last year and finally sealing the deal.  Since taking over a decade ago, Gorman has pulled off multiple big acquisitions. He orchestrated the bank’s takeover of Smith Barney, making wealth management the cornerstone of his plan to stabilize revenue. E*Trade, which became popular nearly two decades ago with   commercials that blasted financial advisers for high fees, had been under the gun as the online trading space became more competitive with increased cut-throat pricing. Revenue growth at the brokerage, like at rivals, has taken a hit in recent years from the emergence of digital upstarts called roboadvisers, falling commissions and lower interest rates, prompting consolidation in the sector. Late last year, E*Trade’s biggest rival Charles Schwab Corp agreed to buy TD Ameritrade Holding Corp for $26 billion. Morgan Stanley will get E*Trade’s more than 5.2 million client accounts and $360 billion of retail client assets, and the brokerage’s CEO, Mike Pizzi, will continue to run the business following the merger. Slideshow (5 Images)E*Trade shareholders will get 1.0432 Morgan Stanley shares for each share as part of the deal. That translates to $58.74 per share - a premium of 30.7% to the last closing price of E*Trade shares. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020.

    "Title": "L Brands sells majority stake in Victoria's Secret, CEO Wexner to step down",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - L Brands Inc (LB.N) said on Thursday it will sell a controlling stake in its Victoria’s Secret unit to investment firm Sycamore Partners, valuing the lingerie brand at $1.1 billion, as it focuses on its core Bath \u0026 Body Works brand. The private equity firm will own 55% of Victoria’s Secret, the world’s best known specialty retailer for lingerie, while L Brands will keep a 45% stake. The Columbus, Ohio-based company’s Bath \u0026 Body Works, which sells soaps and home fragrances, would be run as a standalone company. Chief Executive Leslie Wexner, who bought Victoria’s Secret in 1982 and shaped its image by hiring supermodels to wear jewel encrusted bras and wings at its annual fashion shows, will step down and hand over to Bath \u0026 Body Works executive Andrew Meslow. Wexner, 82, will become chairman emeritus and Meslow, now chief operating officer at Bath \u0026 Body Works, will join the board. Three other directors, including the lead independent director, will be replaced. The company’s shares were down 3.5 in early trading at $23.45 after having climbed in the last weeks amid speculation that Sycamore would buy the ailing retailer. The moves come after activist investor Barington Capital last year bought a small stake and urged the company to split fast growing Bath \u0026 Body Works from Victoria’s Secret, push Wexner to give up his CEO position and refresh the board, where the majority of directors were men. Barington serves as an adviser to the company. L Brands, which has a market valuation of about $7 billion, has seen sales dwindle at its Victoria’s Secret business as it faces increased competition from online retailers. It has been criticized for an outdated brand image and for lingerie that was not inclusive of all body types. FILE PHOTO: A customer passes by an L Brands Inc., Victoria's Secret retail store in Manhattan, New York, U.S., May 13, 2016.  REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoThe brand accounted for nearly half of the company’s $13.24 billion revenue in 2019, but has seen sales decline for at least four quarters. Bath \u0026 Body Works’ revenue has risen.  “We believe this structure will allow Bath \u0026 Body Works to continue to achieve strong growth and receive its appropriate market valuation,” said Wexner, who owns a 13.24% stake in L Brands and has been leading the company since 1963, making him the longest-serving CEO of a S\u0026P 500 company. The company last year canceled its fashion show and Edward Razek, its chief marketing officer, who was closely  associated with the shows, left.

    "Title": "EU privacy body warns of privacy risks in Google, Fitbit deal",
    "Content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc-owned Google’s $2.1 billion bid for fitness trackers company Fitbit could pose privacy risks, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) warned on Thursday, adding its voice to other critics of the deal. Google announced the deal in November last year, as it seeks to compete with Apple and Samsung in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches.  Fitbit, whose fitness trackers and other devices monitor users’ daily steps, calories burned and distance travelled, would give the U.S. tech giant access to a trove of health data gathered from Fitbit devices. Such access is worrying, the EU privacy watchdog said. “The possible further combination and accumulation of sensitive personal data regarding people in Europe by a major tech company could entail a high level of risk to privacy and data protection,” it said. It urged the companies to assess their data privacy requirements and privacy implications in a transparent way and mitigate possible privacy and data protection risks before seeking EU antitrust approval for the deal. Google said it would never sell personal information to anyone and that Fitbit health and wellness data would not be used for its ads while Fitbit users would have the option to review or delete their data. “Protecting peoples’ information is core to what we do, and we will continue to work constructively with regulators to answer their questions,” the company said in a statement. FILE PHOTO: Fitbit Blaze watch is seen in front of a displayed Google logo in this illustration picture taken, November 8, 2019. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File PhotoEuropean Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who will vet the deal, in November voiced her concerns about big companies targeting data-heavy rivals. The European Commission on Thursday in an emailed comment said it had yet to be formally notified.  “It is always up to the companies to notify transactions with an EU dimension to the European Commission,” it said.

    "Title": "Thyssenkrupp nears full sale of $17 billion elevator division: sources",
    "Content": "FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) is nearing a full sale of its elevator division, three people familiar with the matter said, adding that this would secure the highest valuation of about 16 billion euros ($17.3 billion) to help the company pay down debt. Thyssenkrupp's logo is seen outside the elevator test tower in Rottweil, Germany, January 21, 2020.  REUTERS/Michaela RehleThe sale, potentially Europe’s biggest private equity transaction in 13 years, is entering its final stretch, with two buyout consortia in a neck-and-neck race to acquire the world’s fourth-largest lift maker. Under the deal, Thyssenkrupp would likely sell all of the division, Elevator Technology, to realise the highest valuation, the people said. The 16 billion euros is roughly the same as the combined total of the group’s net debt - which soared in the last quarter - and pension liabilities.  There is a small chance the group could retain a minority stake in the business, the people said, adding the likelihood of that happening had decreased in recent weeks. Thyssenkrupp declined to comment. Shares in Thyssenkrupp rose as much as 1.4% on the news before trading down 0.7% at 1548 GMT. The company, a steel-to-submarines conglomerate, said this week it would either sell a majority stake or all of the unit. Labour representatives, as well as the group’s top shareholder, the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach foundation, have argued in favour of keeping a stake. “Of course it would be profitable for the company to keep a stake,” Ursula Gather, who heads the foundation’s board of trustees and also sits on Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board, told the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. ‘REGRETTABLE’ Gather said many factors had to be taken into account as part of the deal. “But again, the decision lies with the management board,” she said, adding there had to be a fast decision on how proceeds would be spent, including on how cash could be provided to the group’s steel business. Any private equity sale would likely see the elevator division being loaded up with debt, lowering the chance it will have enough room to pay dividends or pass on huge amounts of cash, the people said, making a stake less attractive. Thyssenkrupp said this week it was focusing on talks with two consortia: Blackstone (BX.N), Carlyle (CG.O) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board; and Advent and Cinven [CINV.UL]. Sources have previously said the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany’s RAG foundation were part of the Advent/Cinven tie-up, which sources said submitted a bid just shy of the roughly 16 billion euros offered by its rival consortium. Finland’s Kone (KNEBV.HE), which had made a bid of more than 17 billion euros, dropped out. “From a shareholder view it is of course regrettable that the highest bid won’t be successful but apparently Thyssenkrupp has no time to lose,” said Michael Muders, fund manager at Union Investment, a top-20 shareholder.  “The price is still attractive.” Bidders have until next week to make final changes to their binding bids submitted this month, one of the people said. Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Feb. 27 and could make a decision, sources have previously said. Thyssenkrupp, which is keeping open the option of listing the elevator unit, aims to wrap up the process in February but talks could delay the process to March, one of the people said.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: The logo of French energy company Engie on an office building in La Defense business district in Courbevoie, near Paris, France, October 12, 2019. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo(Reuters) - French power utility Engie SA has approached Ameresco Inc, a U.S. provider of energy efficiency solutions and developer of renewable energy plants, to express interest in acquiring it, according to people familiar with the matter. The approach will test the appetite of Ameresco’s 72-year-old chairman and chief executive, George Sakellaris, to cash out. Sakellaris founded the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company in 2000 and remains its controlling shareholder. The sources cautioned that there is no certainty that Engie’s interest will lead to deal negotiations and an agreement with Ameresco. They asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Engie and Ameresco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Ameresco shares jumped as much as 15% in New York on the news and were trading up 5% at $23.94 Thursday afternoon, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.1 billion. Engie shares ended trading in Paris down 1% at 16.48 euros, giving it a market value of 40.1 billion euros ($43.3 billion).  Ameresco provides energy efficiency services to customers such as public housing authorities, colleges and federal government buildings. It also builds, operates and maintains landfill gas-to-energy, solar and wind renewable energy plants. Engie’s interest in Ameresco comes after it said earlier this month it would not renew the mandate of its chief executive, Isabelle Kocher. Engie, formerly known as GDF Suez, said it put in place an interim management team as it searches for a new boss. The company added it needed to clarify its strategic options and boost its business model in renewable energies and client solutions. Engie has acquired several energy services companies in North America, most recently Conti Corp last year.

    "Title": "Shares of HNA affiliates rally after report of China bailout plan",
    "Content": "BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shares in affiliates of HNA Group surged on Thursday following a news report that China plans to take over the debt-laden conglomerate as the coronavirus outbreak has further hit its ability to meet financial obligations. FILE PHOTO: The HNA Group logo is seen on the gate of HNA Plaza building in Beijing, China July 4, 2018. REUTERS/Elias GlennThe government of the southern province of Hainan, where HNA [HNAIRC.UL] is based, is in talks to take control of the group and sell off its airline assets, Bloomberg said on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. HNA, which controls or holds stakes in a number of domestic carriers including its flagship Hainan Airlines (600221.SS), did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. China’s aviation regulator said last week it would support restructuring or mergers to help airlines cope with the fallout of the epidemic, which has prompted carriers to cancel thousands of flights. The Bloomberg report said that under the plan most of HNA’s airline assets would be sold to China’s three top carriers - Air China Ltd (601111.SS) (0753.HK), China Southern Airlines Co (600029.SS) (1055.HK) and China Eastern Airlines Corp (600115.SS) (0670.HK). Air China and China Eastern are prepared to hold talks, but a deal could take time as the industry also battles the fallout from the virus outbreak, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Air China and China Eastern did not immediately respond to requests for comment. China Southern declined to comment. Shares in Hainan Airlines, HNA Innovation (600555.SS) and HNA Investment Group (000616.SZ) closed up by their 10% daily limit after the news report of the planned takeover. HNA Technology (600751.SS), Bohai Leasing (000415.SZ) and HNA Infrastructure Investment Group (600515.SS) posted gains in a range of 3.9% to 8.8%. Hong Kong-listed stocks linked to HNA also rose. Heavily indebted HNA Group has restructured jet orders with Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA) in a deal that includes an order for dozens of A330neo jets, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. TOUGH OUTLOOK HNA Group was once one of China’s most aggressive dealmaking firms, spending $50 billion on acquisitions that included stakes in Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and Hilton Worldwide (HLT.N), and prime property in New York, Sydney and San Francisco. Its total borrowings were 706.7 billion yuan ($100.6 billion) as of the end of June, data filed to the government shows. “HNA does have money to pay back but the money is actually within its subsidiaries, which they cannot draw on to pay back the bondholders,” said Warut Promboon, head of credit research at Bondcritic. “There are still bonds coming due and if the government is taking it over, we believe they have to honour the debt.” HNA began unwinding many acquisitions to focus on its core airlines and tourism businesses after racking up high levels of debt and drawing regulatory scrutiny. But the prices HNA has sought and the complex structures, loans and other business bonds among its holdings have made it tough to unwind them, bankers said. In December, Chairman Chen Feng said the firm had delayed some salary payments in 2019 because of cash flow shortages, but vowed to resolve liquidity risks in 2020. However, the virus outbreak has pressured its core airline business this year, with Hong Kong Airlines, part-owned by HNA, announcing a plan to cut 400 jobs this month.

    "Title": "T-Mobile owner sets sights on becoming U.S. number one",
    "Content": "BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) is aiming to become market leader in the United States, CEO Tim Hoettges said on Wednesday, now that a deal for its T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) unit to take over Sprint (S.N) is within reach. Striking a bullish tone after a New York judge threw out a petition brought by a dozen U.S. states to block the deal, Hoettges said the ‘new’ T-Mobile would go on the attack and look to close a valuation gap with AT\u0026T (T.N) and Verizon (VZ.N). “We have the chance to become No.1 in the United States, to overtake AT\u0026T and Verizon. That is our ambition,” Hoettges told reporters in Bonn after Deutsche Telekom reported record annual results in its 25th year as a listed company. Ebullient, Hoettges brandished a coffee cup bearing a picture of U.S. World War Two character Rosie the Riveter and the slogan ‘We Can Do It’ in front of photographers. His mood was buoyed further by a 3.7% jump in Deutsche Telekom shares, bringing year-to-date gains to 13%. “The results were strong, particularly in Europe, and reassuring on Germany,” said Citi analyst Georgios Ierodiaconou. Related CoverageWe can live with German, EU ideas on vendor regulation: Deutsche TelekomMerged T-Mobile U.S. to close valuation gap on Big Two: Deutsche Telekom CEOHoettges, 57, has campaigned for seven years to do a U.S. deal that, on completion, would create a transatlantic business with $120 billion in revenues and 270 million customers. A breakthrough came in April 2018 when T-Mobile and Sprint, controlled by Japan’s Softbank Group (9984.T), agreed to a $26 billion all-stock deal. The process of winning anti-trust approved dragged: Concessions offered in a back-and-forth with U.S. regulators brought the deal close to the finish line last year, but the suit filed by attorneys general from mainly Democrat-led states threatened to derail it within sight of the finish line. With last week’s New York court ruling in favor of the deal, Hoettges now expects it to close by April 1, subject to resolving outstanding regulatory and legal issues. Importantly, synergies of $43 billion targeted in the original merger remained intact, Hoettges said. Once completed, the German group would own 42% of the ‘new’ T-Mobile but have a voting stake of 67% and control of the board. Hoettges declined to comment when asked whether T-Mobile would seek to drive a harder bargain in the deal, which has passed its expiry date but is still supported by both parties, to reflect a deterioration in Sprint’s business. Timotheus Hoettges, Chief Executive Officer of Germany's telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom AG arrives for the company's annual news conference in Bonn, Germany, February 19, 2020.      REUTERS/Wolfgang RattayVALUATION GAP Highlighting the positive market reaction after the New York  ruling, Hoettges said the new T-Mobile would have a market value on paper of around $120 billion. That compares with $274 billion for AT\u0026T (T.N) and $242 billion for Verizon (VZ.N).  “That is a difference of around $120 billion. I see no reason why this cannot be reduced considerably,” he said, highlighting Sprint’s spectrum assets as a key competitive advantage. The three main U.S. wireless carriers would have similar customer numbers of between 140 million and 150 million, Hoettges added: “That puts us on an equal footing and in a position to ramp up attacks on the competition.” Deutsche Telekom forecast core earnings of 25.5 billion euros ($27.5 billion) this year, representing a slowdown in growth to 3% and below analysts’ consensus forecast. That guidance does not take into account the impact of the U.S. merger and Deutsche Telekom will revise its outlook once it goes through. Slideshow (3 Images)Uncertainty over the deal has weighed on the group balance sheet, as have the heavy costs of building next-generation 5G networks, forcing Deutsche Telekom in November to say it would cut its 2019 dividend. The group reduced its net debt by 2.8 billion euros in the fourth quarter to 76 billion euros, bringing its leverage ratio back down to 2.65 times adjusted EBITDA - back within management’s comfort zone of 2.25-2.75 times core earnings.

FILE PHOTO: Terminal tractors line up as they are loaded with containers from a cargo ship at DP World's fully automated Terminal 2 at Jebel Ali Port in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, December 27, 2018.  REUTERS/ Hamad I Mohammed/File PhotoDubai announced this week one of its state companies, Port and Free Zone World (PFZW), part of state investment vehicle Dubai World, aims to buy publicly listed shares of port operator DP World in a deal with a $13.9 billion valuation which will end up adding billions of dollars of debt to DP World’s books. Citi and Deutsche Bank have underwritten roughly $9 billion of debt for the transaction and have started discussions with other lenders to decrease their exposure by distributing the debt, the sources said.  The banks declined to comment. DP World did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dubai World, a conglomerate with interests in ports, real estate and hospitality, signed a $25 billion debt restructuring agreement in 2011 after Dubai was hit by the global financial crisis. DP World’s planned de-listing will add leverage to the company, which pushed rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch to put the firm under review this week for a potential downgrade. As part of the deal, DP World will borrow $5.15 billion to fund a dividend to Dubai World, which is the sole shareholder of PFZW, helping it meet outstanding obligations to lenders. “The sizable dividend payment to Dubai World breaks our current assumption that DP World’s credit profile is unaffected by the debt burden at the level of Dubai World,” Moody’s said. The $9 billion in debt includes the dividend payment, $2.7 billion for the purchase of the listed shares, and the refinancing of some debt maturities, said one of the sources. “New money for the deal is only the one needed to buy the shares, the rest is just refinancing,” he said. After the 2009 debt crisis, Dubai had to rely on $20 billion in bailout loans from Abu Dhabi and the UAE central bank to stave off a sovereign default. Fitch said last year that Dubai may need to again restructure a significant part of $23 billion in loans raised by Dubai government-related entities and due to mature by the end of next year. One of the sources said that while the DP World de-listing involves a debt repayment for Dubai World, the deal was not engineered to consolidate Dubai’s debt or extend its maturities. DP World said in a statement this week the de-listing would allow it to focus on its medium- to long-term strategy and that the demands of the equity markets for short term returns were incompatible with its long-term plans.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Vodafone, Telecom Italia offer rivals access to some sites to ease EU concerns - EU paper",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: Different types of 4G, 5G and data radio relay antennas for mobile phone networks are pictured on a relay mast operated by Vodafone in Berlin, Germany, April 8, 2019. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File PhotoBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Vodafone (VOD.L) and Telekom Italia (TLIT.MI) have offered to allow rivals access to sites in some cities for up to nine years, a proposal aimed at allaying EU antitrust concerns over the creation of Italy’s largest mobile tower company, according to an EU document seen by Reuters. The companies announced the deal in July last year which will see Vodafone  transfer its Italian mobile masts to INWIT (INWT.MI), TIM’s 60%-owned subsidiary.  They will each have a 37.5% stake and equal governance rights in the enlarged INWIT. For the telecoms industry, combining towers or sharing networks to reduce debt and share costs are seen as an alternative to counter EU antitrust regulators’ tough line on telecoms mergers that reduce the number of players in a market from four to three. Under Vodafone and TIM’s proposal, INWIT will make available around 630 sites in towns with more than 35,000 people, allowing rivals to provide current and future mobile and fixed telephony services, the document said.   Access will be between 6-9 years and renewable up to six years. The number of sites made available will gradually decrease to just below 400 during the fifth year of the companies’ proposal which will be valid for eight years. Access will be granted on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms while a fast track system will allow companies to resolve disputes. The Commission is now seeking feedback from the companies’ rivals and from consumers before deciding whether to accept the offer, demand further measures or open a full-scale investigation. Mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) in Italy want the companies to provide access to their network once the deal is completed, especially as they roll out 5G infrastructure, sources close to the matter told Reuters. MVNOs offer mobile services to their customers over the wireless network infrastructure of bigger rivals. Reporting by Foo Yun CheeOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Qatar Airways spends $600 million to lift stake in BA owner to 25%",
    "Content": "LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Airways has bought a $600 million stake in British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L) to increase its holding to 25.1%, strengthening its position ahead of a change in IAG management. FILE PHOTO: A Qatar Airways  Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner airplane is pictured at Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport in Rome, Italy, March 30, 2019. REUTERS/Alberto LingriaIn an endorsement of the Anglo-Spanish group just weeks before its founder Willie Walsh steps down, Qatar said on Wednesday the move showed its support for IAG and its strategy.     Qatar previously held 21.4% of IAG, which also owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling and Ireland’s Aer Lingus. IAG’s share price has risen by 52% in the last six months.  Qatar increased its holding after IAG lifted restrictions on investments from outside the European Union last month. IAG, which is registered in Madrid and headquartered in London, capped its equity held outside the EU at 47.5% a year ago to comply with EU ownership rules, a situation that could be further complicated by Britain’s departure from the EU. It said in January non-EU ownership had fallen to 39.5%, so the cap was no longer required.    At 1110 GMT, IAG shares were up 0.8% at 637 pence, giving it  a market value of 12.67 billion pounds ($16.4 billion). State-owned Qatar Airways, one of the Middle East’s biggest carriers, has said its investments in other carriers were mostly for financial purposes. It does not have an IAG board seat. It bought some of its holdings after the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia banned it from their airspace after a regional political dispute, which Qatar Airways has blamed for its recent losses.     It has minority holdings in international carriers Cathay Pacific (0293.HK) and China Southern (600029.SS), and said earlier this month it was interested in doubling its holding in LATAM Airlines Group (LTM.SN) to 20% and was in talks to buy a 49% stake in Africa’s RwandAir.     The airline also owns 49% of Air Italy, whose investors this month said was being placed into liquidation because of “persistent and structural market problems”.     IAG was created by a merger between the British and Spanish flag carriers in 2011, overseen by Walsh, who will step down next month. Luis Gallego, who has led Iberia since 2014, will succeed Walsh, an appointment that analysts said signaled little change of direction for the group.  Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said: “Our investment to date has been highly successful and the announced increase in our shareholding is evidence of our continued support of IAG and its strategy.”    The cost of increasing its IAG holding is 465 million pounds, based on the closing price of IAG’s shares on Tuesday.  Qatar first invested in IAG in 2015, buying 9.99% of the company, and has steadily increased its holding since then.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoBONN, Germany (Reuters) - The merger between T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) and Sprint (S.N) is within reach, the head of its main owner Deutsche Telekom said, forecasting that the combined business would quickly close a valuation gap on market leaders AT\u0026T (T.N) and Verizon (VZ.N).  Highlighting the positive market reaction after a New York judge last week dismissed a lawsuit brought by more than a dozen U.S. states trying to block the deal, CEO Tim Hoettges said the ‘new’ T-Mobile would have a market value of around $120 billion. That compares to $274 billion for AT\u0026T and $242 billion for Verizon, he added in remarks prepared for a news conference on Wednesday. “That is a difference of around $120 billion. I see no reason why this cannot be reduced considerably,” he said. The three main wireless carriers would have similar customer numbers of between 140 million and 150 million, he added: “That puts us on an equal footing and in a position to ramp up attacks on the competition.”  Reporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Michelle MartinOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the share price for pharmaceutical maker AbbVie on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange July 18, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of unions and consumer groups wrote to U.S. antitrust enforcers on Tuesday to oppose a proposed remedy that could lead to U.S. approval for AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) planned purchase of Allergan Plc (AGN.N). In its letter to the Federal Trade Commission, which is reviewing the merger to ensure it is legal, the groups argued that a plan for the companies to divest Allergan’s brazikumab, which is being developed to treat ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, was inadequate to resolve antitrust concerns raised by the planned deal. AbbVie did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The groups argued that the proposed buyer, AstraZeneca, appeared to have little incentive to bring the drug to market and that rebates offered by AbbVie for its Skyrizi drug would slow brazikumab’s success in the market since both drugs treat similar ailments. “We are skeptical that the divestiture to AstraZeneca of Allergan’s brazikumab, a drug in development, can adequately address the anticompetitive effects of the merger,” said the letter, which was signed by the American Federation of Teachers, Families USA, U.S. PIRG Education Fund, Service Employees International Union (SEIU), American Federation of State, County, \u0026 Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and 12 other groups.   The $63 billion deal, which is expected to close this quarter, was approved by the European Union in January.  The deal was initially announced in June as a way for AbbVie to win control over the lucrative wrinkle treatment Botox and buy time to seek new growth before its blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira loses U.S. patent protection. AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said at the time that the company was able to buy Allergan because of the cash that Humira generates.

    "Title": "Alstom, Bombardier shares fall after $6.7 billion rail deal",
    "Content": "PARIS/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Shares of Alstom SA and Montreal-based Bombardier Inc fell on Tuesday after the French firm agreed to buy its Canadian rival’s rail division for up to 6.2 billion euros ($6.7 billion), a deal likely to draw scrutiny from competition regulators and unions concerned about job cuts. FILE PHOTO: A logo of Alstom is seen at the Alstom's plant in Semeac near Tarbes, France, February 15, 2019.   REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File PhotoThe cash and shares deal, announced Monday, will make the combined entity the world’s second-biggest train maker after China’s state-owned CRRC Corp. It is  the latest attempt by Western rail firms to try to build scale to lower costs.  JP Morgan analysts said there was uncertainty ahead “during a lengthy anti-trust process.” Bombardier shares were down 7.88% at C$1.52 near midday on Tuesday. Alstom shares closed 3.2% lower at 48.70 euros in Paris. Bombardier would use sale proceeds to cut its debt, which has been a concern for investors and rating agencies. Its net debt would drop to $2.5 billion once the deal closes in the first half of 2021. But it also leaves Bombardier as the only large pure business jet maker, compared with rivals which also generate revenue from military sales. “If there were a serious market downturn, they would be at a major disadvantage, since there would be no defense revenue to compensate,” said U.S. aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group.  Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said the company is focused on the “most resilient market segments,” of business aviation, including large cabin corporate aircraft and an aftermarket business that is “less susceptible to economic cycles.” “We are more than viable as a pure play,” he told Reuters by email. Alstom executives have sought to quell concerns about any hurdles they might face over competition issues, after EU regulators blocked its attempt to merge rail assets with Germany’s Siemens AG last year.  U.S. regulators will also examine the deal, a Bombardier spokesman said. The Bombardier acquisition has a lower market share in signaling than the Siemens option, which had been one of the main sticking points with regulators, Alstom Chief Executive Henri Poupart-Lafarge said on Monday.  The transaction was complementary, with Bombardier more present in Northern Europe and Alstom in the south, Poupart-Lafarge said, adding it would not affect jobs. The combined groups would have some 10,000 staff, including temporary workers, in Germany, where Bombardier Transportation has its headquarters and seven factories.  FILE PHOTO: A worker walks in front of a Bombardier advertising board at the SBB CFF Swiss railway train station in Bern, Switzerland, October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File PhotoFrance would be the second-biggest market in Europe, with some 6,730 total employees.  French trade unions were initially sanguine about the transaction, saying they were reassured by the fact Alstom was still in hiring mode at the moment and that order books were full.  Regarding job cuts, “the project, such as it has been presented to us, does not seem to be leading down that road, but we remain very vigilant,” Patrick de Cara, a representative for the CFDT union at Alstom, said.

    "Title": "Exclusive: JPMorgan shakes up investment bank in leadership makeover - sources",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) is reshuffling senior management at the top of its investment bank, naming two new global co-heads and shifting some of its most senior dealmakers into new jobs focused purely on bringing in business, two sources told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: The J.P.Morgan logo is seen at  Canary Wharf financial district in London,Britain, March 3, 2016.  REUTERS/Reinhard Krause/File PhotoThe Wall Street bank has named Viswas Raghavan and James Casey to jointly run its global investment banking unit, one source said. The appointments are part of a sweeping reshuffle in which some senior executives will take on “rainmaker” roles. Global M\u0026A co-heads Hernan Cristerna and Chris Ventresca are among those who will drop management responsibilities and instead join a new executive committee of 18 global chairs, the two sources said, focused on winning business from clients. To fill their shoes the bank is promoting eight bankers to manage specific regions and products, the first source said. These include Dorothee Blessing and Conor Hillery who will become co-heads of investment banking in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Fernando Rivas who is taking the helm of the same unit in North America. Raghavan and Casey - currently chief executive officer and head of banking for EMEA and global head of debt capital markets respectively - will both report into JPMorgan’s global banking head Carlos Hernandez who is in turn taking on a new role as executive chairman of global investment banking, one source said. This source said Raghavan would keep his EMEA chief executive job, reporting to the bank’s co-president Daniel Pinto in this capacity. JPMorgan’s leadership makeover highlights the pressures big investment banks are under to retain senior staff in the face of increasing competition from rival boutiques which can attract  seasoned bankers with more entrepreneurial roles. Wall Street firms face a tricky balancing act to keep their long-serving top managers happy while providing promotion opportunities for the next generation of leaders. “This is the bulge-bracket response to the boutiques’ threat,” the second source said. “It is a good way to motivate senior bankers who tend to move to boutiques when they feel there is nothing more to achieve in their current roles,” he said. Related CoverageFactbox: JPMorgan names new global leaders at investment bank - sourcesIn investment banking, titles such as managing director or senior vice chairman are the ultimate status symbols, a sign that someone has made it. But with many bankers reaching the “managing director” grade in their early thirties, banks are looking for new ways to motivate them and reward their loyalty. ELITE CLUB Hernandez, who is driving the changes, wants the bank’s global chairman network to focus solely on client relationships and also to mentor a new breed of dealmakers, the two sources said. “This is not a trophy title,” the first source said. “People will need to bring in real business.” Current wealth management executive chair Andy Cohen is set to be part of the new global chairmen group while continuing in his previous role. Three women have made it to the same executive committee, namely global head of equity capital markets Liz Myers and global chairs Isabelle Sellier and Jennifer Nason whose focus has so far been on financial services and TMT respectively, the source said. The group will also include healthcare rainmaker Steven Frank and several existing vice chairs such as London-based Harry Hampson and New York-based Ben Berinstein, the source said. Under the new structure, Anu Aiyengar and Dirk Albersmeier will take over from Cristerna and Ventresca as global co-heads of M\u0026A, the source said. Power sharing will also apply to equity capital markets with Achintya Mangla and Mike Millman becoming global co-heads of ECM while Kevin Foley will run global debt capital markets (DCM) alone, the source said. Asia Pacific will not be impacted by the changes with Filippo Gori continuing as head of banking for the region and similarly Martin Marron will stay in charge of investment banking in Latin America and Canada. All the regional and product heads – who will report into Raghavan and Casey – will need to ensure JPMorgan maintains its 2019 ranking, based on Refinitiv data, as the top global investment bank by fees, having earned $6.5 billion in fees, or 6.5% of the overall global fee pool ahead of Goldman Sachs (GS.N).

    "Title": "Xerox courts HP shareholders as takeover battle heats up",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - U.S. printer maker Xerox Holdings Corp (XRX.N) is hosting a dinner for HP Inc (HPQ.N) shareholders this week as it seeks investor support to overcome the personal computer maker’s resistance to its $35 billion takeover bid, according to people familiar with the matter. FILE PHOTO: The company logo for Xerox is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 11, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe charm offensive comes after Xerox raised its cash-and-stock bid for HP last week by $2 to $24 per share ahead of a tender offer it plans to launch in early March. It is also asking HP shareholders to replace HP’s board directors with Xerox’s nominees at the company’s annual shareholder meeting later this year. HP, whose shares ended on Friday at $22.37, is expected to dismiss the sweetened offer as inadequate when it unveils its most recent quarterly earnings on Feb. 24. It told investors last week it wants them to have “full information” on the company before responding publicly to Xerox.  Xerox has invited some HP shareholders to a dinner at a restaurant in the Riverside neighborhood of Greenwich, Connecticut on Feb. 18, the sources said. Xerox CEO John Visentin is expected to attend, one of the sources added. Enough HP shareholders backing HP CEO Enrique Lores could embolden the company to remain independent or hold out for a better deal. Other such meetings are possible in the coming days, said another of the sources, who asked not to be identified because the meeting is confidential.  Xerox and HP did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Xerox has said it expects the combination with HP, which has four times its market capitalization of about $8 billion, to yield approximately $2 billion in cost synergies. The two companies focus on complementary segments of the printing market. The printing industry is in decline as companies and consumers turn to digital documents to save money and help the environment. This has put pressure on companies in the sector to consolidate and reverse their revenue decline through acquisitions that can boost their market share.  HP, which separated from servers and networking equipment provider Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Inc (HPE.N) in 2015, has participated in this consolidation, acquiring Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s (005930.KS) printer business for $1.05 billion in 2017.  HP has been reluctant to engage in deal discussions with Xerox since November, when the latter launched its takeover campaign after reaching a settlement with Fujifilm Holdings Corp (4901.T) that resolved a legal dispute over their 57-year-old joint venture and a previous attempt to merge, yielding a $2.3 billion after-tax payoff for Xerox.  Lores, previously the president of HP’s imaging, printing and solutions business, also assumed his duties as CEO last November, succeeding Dion Weisler.  HP did negotiate with Xerox last year at the invitation of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a top Xerox shareholder who has since also acquired a stake in HP, according to the sources. The talks stalled after the companies failed to agree on the amount of confidential information they shared with each other, the sources said. HP relies on its desktop and notebook personal computers business for the majority of its net revenue, but gets the bulk of its earnings from its printing hardware and supplies division.  It has disputed the value of the cost synergies that Xerox has put forward, and argued that its sale to Xerox would saddle the combined company with too much debt. HP has also raised questions on the impact on Xerox’s supply chain of losing Fujifilm as a partner.  RESTRUCTURING OPERATIONS HP is also mindful of large acquisitions given its fateful deal for British software company Autonomy almost a decade ago. HP bought Autonomy for $11.1 billion in 2011 as the centerpiece of its unsuccessful pivot to software. A little over a year later, it wrote off $8.8 billion, $5 billion of which it put down to accounting improprieties, misrepresentation and disclosure failures.   Xerox’s stock has rallied under Visentin, a former Hewlett-Packard and IBM Corp (IBM.N) executive with ties to the private equity industry who took over as Xerox CEO in 2018.  FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the logo for HP Inc. at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., November 18, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThanks to an operational restructuring program dubbed ‘Project Own It’, Visentin has managed to take out costs and is seeking to return Xerox to revenue growth by 2021. He has also boosted the company’s stock through share buybacks.  HP has also announced a cost-saving program worth more than $1 billion that could result in its shedding about 16% of its workforce, or about 9,000 employees, over the next few years.

    "Content": "(Reuters) - Alstom SA on Monday agreed to buy Bombardier Inc’s train business for up to 6.2 billion euros ($6.7 billion), days after Airbus SE agreed to buy out Bombardier’s remaining stake in the A220 passenger jet program, helping the company improve its financial position.  FILE PHOTO: The 100th Bombardier Regio 2N electric double-deck train, the tenth for the Hauts-de-France region, is pictured at the Bombardier plant in Crespin, near Valenciennes, northern France, October 17, 2016. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File PhotoHere is a timeline of Bombardier’s evolution from a company selling snowmobiles decades ago, to a plane and train maker in recent years, and now – just a business jet maker after the Alstom deal. The information is sourced from Bombardier’s website and other publicly available information. 1937-1959: Joseph-Armand Bombardier launches the seven-passenger B7 snowmobile, founds the L’Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitee and launches the world-famous Ski-Doo. 1970: Bombardier ventures into the railway business with its purchase of motor scooter and tram maker Lohnerwerke and its subsidiary, the engine manufacturer ROTAX. 1974-1982: Bombardier wins its first mass transit contract to manufacture 423 cars for the city of Montréal’s subway system and then goes on to win a $1 billion U.S. contract to supply 825 subway cars for the New York City Transit Authority. 1986: The company expands into the aerospace industry with its buyout of Canadair, maker of Challenger wide-body business jets and the CL-215 amphibious firefighting aircraft. 2001: Bombardier buys Germany-based DaimlerChrysler AG’s subsidiary, propelling it to the position of a global leader in the rail equipment manufacturing and servicing industry. 2008: Bombardier launched C-Series program and announces the appointment of Pierre Beaudoin as president and chief executive officer. 2010: Concerns crop up over delays with the C-Series jets, which promised market-beating performance when launched due to new engine technology and a lighter airframe. 2015: Beaudoin steps down as CEO, handing over the reins to Alain Bellemare as the company copes with mounting cost overruns for the C-Series. In October, Quebec announces $1 billion in investment in the C-Series. 2017: Canadian government announces C$372 million aid package for Bombardier in the form of repayable loans. Later that year, Airbus SE takes a majority stake in Bombardier Inc’s C-Series jet program for $1. 2018: Under Bellemare’s leadership, Bombardier pares down repeatedly by selling off its 148-hectare Downsview manufacturing site in Toronto, its Q400 turboprop aircraft program, among others. 2019: Bombardier announces plans to sell off factories in Northern Ireland and Morocco as it consolidates its commercial plane-making business and later agrees to sell its regional jet program to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. Feb 2020: Airbus teams up with the Quebec government to buy Bombardier’s 33.5% stake in the A220 passenger jet program - formerly known as the C Series - completing the Canadian firm’s exit from civil aviation.

    "Title": "DP World returns to full state ownership, takes on $8.1 billion debt",
    "Content": "(This 17th Feb. story corrects final paragraph to “raised” not “valued”) FILE PHOTO: General view of a stock yard of DP World's fully automated Terminal 2 at Jebel Ali Port in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, December 27, 2018. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed/File PhotoDUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai is to take full control of port operator DP World (DPW.DI) in a deal with a $13.9 billion valuation that will help the company at the center of the emirate’s 2009 debt crisis to repay some of its borrowings.  DP World, which operates ports around the world from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires, will take on $8.1 billion in debt to finance the deal in which Port and Free Zone World, part of state investment vehicle Dubai World, will acquire the 19.55% of Nasdaq Dubai listed shares for $2.7 billion. Port and Free Zone World already owns 80.55% of DP World ordinary share capital. It will also pay Dubai World $5.15 billion, helping it to meet outstanding obligations to lenders so that DP World can implement its strategy without restrictions. Dubai World subsidiaries face certain restrictions due to  agreements with creditors but DP World had been exempt from those restrictions as long as it was listed. Dubai World agreed a $25 billion debt restructuring in 2011. Port and Free Zone World will finance the transaction with new facilities arranged by Citibank (C.N) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which also advised it on the deal, a filing said.  DP World will be the borrower and guarantor of some $8.1 billion after the buy-back and the $5.15 billion payment, the filing said. DP World, which listed in 2007, is headquartered at the Middle East’s biggest transhipment hub, Jebel Ali Port in Dubai. Proceeds from the loans raised could also be used by DP World to fund the potential redemption of its convertible bonds, the filing said.  Following the deal, Port and Free Zone World and DP World will try to deleverage and maintain a target of 4.0 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA, the filing said. DP World will also look into raising debt in global debt markets to refinance part of the deal’s debt with longer maturities, it said.   WEAKER CREDIT DP World is delisting to focus on its medium-to-long-term strategy of becoming “the world’s leading logistics provider,” Chairman Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem said.  The port operator has diversified its operations to include industrial parks, transportation, and other logistic services assets.  “The demands of the public market for short term returns ... are incompatible with this industry,” bin Sulayem said.  Ratings agencies Fitch and Moody’s placed DP World under review for a potential downgrade on Monday.  “The transaction will weaken the overall credit profile of DP World,” Dion Bate, a Moody’s vice president, said. DP World shares rose 10% on Monday, but they had lost more than a quarter of value over the past year. The firm’s independent directors were advised by Rothschild on the transaction, the filing said. The operator raised $4.96 billion when it listed in 2007. It was also listed on the London Stock Exchange between 2011 and 2015.

    "Title": "EU industry chief tells Facebook to adapt to EU, not other way round",
    "Content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU industry commissioner Thierry Breton said on Monday it was for Facebook to adapt to Europe’s standards, not the other way round, as he criticized the U.S. social media giant’s proposed internet rules as insufficient. The blunt comments came after a short meeting with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and two days before Breton is due to present the first of a raft of rules to rein in U.S. tech giants and state-aided Chinese companies. “It’s not for us to adapt to this company, it’s for this company to adapt to us,” Breton, a former CEO at French telecoms provider Orange and French technology company Atos, told reporters after the meeting. Zuckerberg had earlier told reporters he had a good, wide-ranging conversation with Breton. Breton also said he would decide by the end of the year whether to adopt tough rules as part of the digital services act to regulate online platforms and set out their responsibilities. He dismissed a discussion paper issued by Facebook on Monday that rejects what it calls intrusive regulations and suggests looser rules whereby companies would periodicially report content and publish enforcement data. “It’s not enough,” Breton said, adding that Facebook had omitted any mention of its market dominance and also failed to spell out its responsibilities. FORCE FOR GOOD OR BAD? EU justice chief Vera Jourova, who also met Zuckerberg, was equally adamant on Facebook’s role in the fight against online hate speech, disinformation and election manipulation. “Facebook cannot push away all the responsibility. Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg have to answer themselves a question ‘who do they want to be’ as a company and what values they want to promote,” she said in a statement. “It will not be up to governments or regulators to ensure that Facebook wants to be a force of good or bad.” Breton will announce proposals on Wednesday aimed at exploiting the EU’s trove of industrial data and challenging the dominance of Facebook, Google and Amazon. It will announce rules to govern the use of artificial intelligence too, which will also affect companies such as Facebook. Slideshow (4 Images)Referring to the possibility that the EU may hold internet companies responsible for hate speech and other illegal speech published on their platforms, Facebook in its discussion document said this ignored the nature of the internet. It urged regulators to understand the capabilities and limitations of technology in assessing content and allow internet companies the flexibility to innovate. Zuckerberg’s visit came on the heels of visits by Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai and Microsoft President Brad Smith to Brussels last month.

    "Title": "Alstom to buy Bombardier rail unit for up to $6.7 billion",
    "Content": "PARIS/MONTREAL (Reuters) - France’s Alstom SA has agreed to buy the rail division of Canada’s Bombardier Inc for up to 6.2 billion euros ($6.7 billion) to create the world’s No. 2 train manufacturer and better take on Chinese leader CRRC Corp.  The cash and shares deal, announced on Monday, is the latest attempt by Western rail firms to try to build scale.  Alstom, the maker of TGV bullet trains that speed between French cities such as Paris and Nice, was blocked last year from merging with Germany’s Siemens AG by European regulators, who argued the deal could penalize consumers.   The agreement between Alstom and Bombardier would unite companies with an estimated $17 billion in combined revenue.  The French firm said the two were complementary geographically, adding Bombardier’s European footprint was stronger in northern countries and the Canadian firm would add expertise in monorail trains as well as rail services.  “We don’t see it as a huge issue,” Alstom Chief Executive Henri Poupart-Lafarge said of regulatory hurdles on a conference call. “If there are some issues, they will be much easier to solve than the one we had with Siemens.”  A combination with Bombardier would give Alstom a share of between 40% and 60% of the European regional train market, according to estimates cited by union sources in France, well above Siemens at 10% to 20%.      But some analysts have said there could be less opposition to a deal this time as Alstom and Bombardier have a lower combined European market share in high-speed rail and signaling. The companies have informally briefed EU antitrust regulators on the deal, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Related CoverageTimeline: Bombardier's journey from Ski-Doo maker to business jet makerThe French government, which had criticized the EU’s veto on the Siemens merger, welcomed the transaction.  “This deal will allow Alstom to prepare for the future, against the backdrop of increasingly intense international competition,” Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said, adding he was due to discuss it with the EU’s antitrust boss, Margrethe Vestager, on Tuesday.  Bombardier and Alstom said they expected the deal to close in the first half of 2021. Their agreement includes a 75 million-euro break fee.  DEBT-LADEN BOMBARDIER Train makers are eyeing consolidation to reduce costs and improve thin rolling stock margins, and Alstom said it also wanted to make the most of a boom in rail travel as consumers switch from planes for environmental reasons.      The merged group would be able to reach annual cost savings of 400 million euros from the fourth year, the company added.  Under the deal, one of the Bombardier rail division’s shareholders, Canadian pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, would become the lead investor in Alstom with an 18% stake. French telecoms-to-construction conglomerate Bouygues would  retain around 10% of Alstom, which said it would finance the transaction by raising equity and with debt. The final price will be between 5.8 billion and 6.2 billion euros, it said.          The deal gives Bombardier’s rail unit an enterprise value - equity plus debt - of $8.2 billion, which would allow the Canadian firm to pay down some of its $9.3 billion in debt.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File PhotoAfter closing, Montreal-based Bombardier would emerge as the only large pure business jet maker, with a focus on expanding  aftermarket sales and margin expansion.   Aerospace analysts cautioned that the loss of rail’s stable contracts would create greater risk for Bombardier in the event of a market downturn.  General Dynamics Corp, parent company of Bombardier’s U.S. rival Gulfstream, generates revenue from military sales in addition to business jets, as does France’s Dassault Aviation. Bombardier has shed businesses after facing a cash crunch in 2015 while bringing a new plane to market. The Alstom deal comes days after it sold its stake in the A220 passenger jet program to Airbus.  It has also been struggling to contain higher rail costs generated by problematic contracts in its nearly $36 billion order backlog, which Alstom said it would look to fix.  “Clearly I would have preferred for things to have turned out differently for Bombardier,” Quebec’s premier, François Legault, said, adding Caisse’s presence in Alstom’s capital was a comfort for Canadian interests.  Bombardier Transportation is headquartered in Berlin and has plants worldwide including at Derby in central England, Mannheim in Germany and Crespin in northern France.      Alstom’s Poupart-Lafarge said the acquisition would not affect jobs.  SIEMENS ON ITS OWN     A previous flirtation between Siemens and Bombardier to combine some train businesses fell apart in 2017. Slideshow (6 Images)A source close to Siemens said there was no sign the firm was planning any type of counterbid, given EU regulators’ tough stance on its previous attempts.  Germany’s IG Metall union called on the German government to look at the matter and raised concerns about an Alstom-Bombardier deal, saying it “would not accept any consolidation at the expense of Germany” should EU regulators allow this combination. State-owned Deutsche Bahn is a big customer of both firms.

    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York on Sunday dropped its fight against the $40 billion merger of U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N), saying the state would not appeal a judge’s approval of the deal.  New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office would end the court challenge to the 2018 merger agreement between the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers.  Instead, she said her office hopes “to work with all the parties to ensure that consumers get the best pricing and service possible, that networks are built out throughout our state, and that good-paying jobs are created here in New York.” A U.S. federal judge gave the companies the green light on Tuesday to complete the deal. New York, California and other states had challenged it on antitrust grounds, saying it would drive up prices for consumers. The office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said it was reviewing the court ruling and its options. “We are mindful that the California Public Utility Commission also has this matter under consideration,” it said on Sunday.     Attorneys general offices for Connecticut and Massachusetts said they are reviewing the decision and evaluating their options. Michigan said it was not in a position to comment. The eight other states in the group and the District of Columbia did not reply to requests for comment. In her statement, New York’s James said the “process has yielded commitments from T-Mobile to create jobs in Rochester and engage in robust national diversity initiatives that will connect our communities with good jobs and technology.” Other states have also stopped pursing their fight by focusing on jobs they were promised. In October, Colorado became the second state, after Mississippi, to drop its legal challenge after striking an agreement with T-Mobile and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), which will buy the assets divested from the merger. FILE PHOTO: Smartphones with the logos of T-Mobile and Sprint are seen in this illustration taken September 19, 2017. REUTERS/Dado RuvicDish pledged to bring 2,000 jobs to Colorado, and T-Mobile agreed to deploy the next generation of wireless 5G across much of the state. No further details were immediately available on any such specific agreement with New York.    The all-stock deal was originally valued at $26 billion. With gains in the value of T-Mobile shares since it was announced, the deal is now worth $40 billion.

    "Title": "Thyssenkrupp shortlists buyout firms for elevator unit, Kone out",
    "Content": "FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) has shortlisted two private equity consortia in the sale of its 16 billion euro ($17 billion) elevator unit, dealing a blow to Finland’s Kone (KNEBV.HE), which withdrew from the closely watched deal. Logo is displayed in an elevator at the KONE Academy of Finish elevators and escalators manufacturer KONE in Hanover, Germany, February 6, 2020. Picture taken February 6, 2020.  REUTERS/Fabian BimmerPotentially Europe’s biggest private-equity deal in 13 years, the transaction is now in its last stages and could come to a head next week when Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board is scheduled to meet. The cash-strapped conglomerate said it would focus on negotiations with two private equity consortia: one consisting of Blackstone (BX.N), Carlyle (CG.O) and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board and another led by Advent and Cinven [CINV.UL]. Shares in Kone plunged nearly 7% on news it had withdrawn, while Thyssenkrupp’s stock dropped as much as 3.7%, reflecting disappointment that a tie-up, which would have created the world’s largest lift maker, was now off the table. “The remaining bidders have submitted more concrete offers. The bids are at a high level and underline the attractiveness of the business,” Thyssenkrupp said in a statement on Monday. The steel-to-submarines group now plans to let the two consortia battle it out in a final round, hoping they will raise their bids to beyond the roughly 16 billion euros offered so far. The elevator division is Thyssenkrupp’s most profitable business and the German group said it aimed to reach an agreement over whether to sell a majority stake or all of it. “A complete sale has always been the base case,” a person familiar with the matter said. CLEANER DEAL If no agreement is reached, an initial public offering remains an option, Thyssenkrupp said, adding this would be possible from early summer. Views in Thyssenkrupp’s 20-member supervisory board had differed over whether to weed out Kone’s bid - the highest in terms of value but also the riskiest in terms of execution - people familiar with the matter said. At more than 17 billion euros, Kone - in partnership with CVC [CVC.UL] - had offered about 1.5 billion euros more than private equity suitors. “The decision to prioritize potentially lower offers indicates, in our opinion, the desire for a cleaner sales process as financial investors should reduce risk of prolonged anti-trust clearance measures in comparison to a conceptual Kone offer,” analysts at Jefferies said.     Labor unions, which control half of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board, were opposed to a deal with Kone from the get-go, fearing it would lead to substantial job cuts. Kone, in a brief statement, said it continued to believe that a combination of its business with Thyssenkrupp Elevator, which would have been the largest acquisition in Finland’s history, would have been strategically compelling. “But in the end we came to a moment where you see that the risks become too significant,” Chief Executive Henrik Ehrnrooth told Reuters, adding he believed that antitrust reviews would not have been an obstacle. Cevian, Thyssenkrupp’s second-largest shareholder with an 18% stake, had been arguing in favor of a deal with Kone, two of the people familiar with the matter said, pointing to substantial synergies. Cevian declined to comment. ($1 = 0.9228 euros) Additional reporting by Anne Kauranen in Helsinki; Editing by Susan Fenton and Mark PotterOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Timeline: NMC Health's expansion and ailments",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - NMC Health (NMC.L) said on Monday its founder BR Shetty had resigned as joint non-executive chairman, months after the UAE healthcare group was thrown into turmoil by doubts over its finances. NMC is the largest private healthcare company in the United Arab Emirates and operates a network of clinics and hospitals, specialized maternity and fertility clinics, and long-term care homes and hospitals across 19 countries. A bruising short-selling attack by Muddy Waters launched two months ago has seen the company’s market value fall to 1.6 billion pounds ($2.1 billion), a far cry from its peak value of about 8.4 billion pounds in August 2018. Here is a timeline of events leading up to Monday’s announcement: 1975 Bavaguthu Raghuram (BR) Shetty establishes New Medical Centre (NMC), the first private healthcare facility in UAE. 2012 NMC becomes the first company from Abu Dhabi to join here the London Stock Exchange. 2015 NMC bids for regional rival Al Noor Hospitals Group, sparking a race with South Africa’s Mediclinic (MDCM.L), before eventually pulling out over valuation concerns. 2017 NMC is promoted to the blue chip FTSE 100 index .FTSE.    2018 NMC raises $2 billion for general corporate purposes and for the refinancing of existing debt, sources say here 2019 October NMC guides for double-digit revenue and core earnings growth in 2020. Dec. 17 U.S. short-selling firm Muddy Waters, founded by American Carson Block, acquires a short position in NMC, criticizing the healthcare group’s financial statements and wiping a third off the value of the company’s share price. Dec. 18 NMC stands by its forecasts for 2019 and 2020 and announces a share buyback. Dec. 19 NMC calls the Muddy Waters report criticizing the healthcare group’s financial statements “false and misleading”.        Dec. 23 NMC calls for an independent review of its finances. 2020 Jan. 8 Two major shareholders launch a discounted share sale in NMC worth 375 million pounds. Jan. 17 Independent review committee hires FBI ex-boss Louis Freeh. Feb. 4 NMC says 2019 trading is in line with expectations.  Feb. 10 NMC discloses preliminary buyout approaches from private equity firms KKR (KKR.N) and GK Investment, and says co-chair and founder Shetty had stepped back from its board after informing the group of potentially inaccurate reporting of his holdings. Feb. 11 KKR says it does not intend to make an offer for NMC, but Italian-backed GKSD Investment Holding confirms it could bid. Feb. 12 S\u0026P places NMC on creditwatch negative due to governance deficiencies. Feb. 13 Moody’s places ratings under review for downgrade. Feb. 14 NMC says its vice chairman is stepping down from the board as it tries to unravel details of the holdings of its top investors. Feb. 17 BR Shetty resigns, leaving UK businessman HJ Mark Tompkins as sole chairman.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A logo of Alstom is seen at the Alstom's plant in Semeac near Tarbes, France, February 15, 2019.   REUTERS/Regis Duvignau(Reuters) - France’s Alstom SA (ALSO.PA) is close to clinching a deal to buy Bombardier Inc’s (BBDb.TO) train business which will give the unit an enterprise value of $7 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter. An announcement could come as soon as Monday, the source said, adding a deal has yet to be signed.  The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said Alstom is expected to buy the business using mostly cash and some stock. Quebec pension giant Caisse de dépôt et placement, which owns a 32.5% stake in Bombardier’s train unit, has agreed to sell its stake to Alstom and buy a minority stake in the combined train company, the WSJ report said. Bombardier declined to comment on the report and Alstom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Canadian plane-and-train-maker has been struggling to contain higher rail costs generated by a few problematic contracts in its nearly $36 billion order backlog. The deal would help Alstom compete more effectively against Chinese rail giant CRRC Corp Ltd (601766.SS), after the French maker of TGV bullet trains was blocked last year by European regulators from merging with Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE).

    "Title": "Regulators should allow RTL and ProSieben to merge: Rabe",
    "Content": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The head of publisher Bertelsmann (BTGGg.F) said its TV arm RTL (RRTL.DE) should be allowed to merge with German rival ProSiebenSat.1 (PSMGn.DE), to give them a fighting chance against U.S. streaming giants. FILE PHOTO: German media group Bertelsmann CEO Thomas Rabe poses for the media prior to the annual news conference Berlin, Germany, March 22, 2016. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File PhotoThomas Rabe’s comments - in an interview with Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung published on Sunday - come as European broadcasters explore ways to join forces against the onslaught from established players Netflix and Amazon Prime that are now being joined by Disney and Apple. “It is vital that sensible partnerships, and even large mergers, are allowed in order to create national champions in television - for example between RTL and ProSiebenSat.1,” Rabe said. “Otherwise, national companies will simply have no chance in a few years against the giants from Silicon Valley,” added the Bertelsmann boss, who took personal charge over its largest unit RTL last year. ProSieben has become the focus of takeover speculation after Italy’s Mediaset (MS.MI) amassed a 15.1% stake in the Munich-based broadcaster towards the end of last year. Mediaset, run by the son of former premier Silvio Berlusconi, has described its ProSieben stake as defensive. At the same time it is trying to persuade ProSieben CEO Max Conze to join a pan-European broadcasting alliance it is setting up. Conze has so far resisted Mediaset’s overtures, preferring to search for ways to cooperate on individual projects. Reacting to Rabe’s comments, ProSieben said: “No talks are taking place at the moment on mergers or acquisitions.” In a statement, ProSieben highlighted work on its adtech joint venture with RTL, called d-force, and repeated its earlier invitation to RTL to sign up to Joyn, its streaming venture with U.S. partner Discovery Inc (DISCA.O). Rabe, in his FAS interview, said it was vital to deregulate the European TV industry because the rules governing it predate the creation of platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Netflix. “Competition law does not take into account the forms in which the U.S. platforms are increasingly coming to dominate the media and advertising,” he said. Although he was wearing two hats as the boss of both Bertelsmann and RTL, Rabe said that did not signify the parent company would increase its 75% stake in the TV unit, nor would it seek a delisting. “RTL Group is and will remain an independent business,” he said.

The consortium led by former Viacom Chief Finiancial Officer Wade Davis and investment company Searchlight Capital Partners is in the lead to acquire the company after submitting the highest bid in an auction.  The deal could value the broadcaster between $8 billion and $10 billion, the source said, adding there was no certainty that a deal would be reached. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news on the talks. Earlier in 2019, the company said that it is exploring a possible sale and had hired advisers. Davis did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment, while Searchlight Capital Partners and Univision declined to comment.

    "Title": "Google protests 'eye-catching' $2.6 billion EU fine, judge disagrees",
    "Content": "LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Google on Friday attacked what it called an eye-catching 2.4 billion euro ($2.6 billion) EU antitrust fine, prompting a judge to ask how a rich company can miss a relatively paltry amount. The sparring underlines the battle ahead for the world’s most popular internet search engine, with two other challenges against EU antitrust enforcers to be heard in the coming months.  The Alphabet unit argued that additional amounts tacked on to the fine imposed by the European Commission in 2017 to deter anti-competitive behavior known as a deterrent multiplier and another multiplier factor was excessive and unwarranted. Google’s challenge came on the final day of a three-day hearing at the General Court, Europe’s second-highest, as it attempts to overturn the first of a trio of EU antitrust penalties totaling 8.25 billion euros. “2.4 billion euros is an eye-catching amount, it might attract the headlines but it is not justified by the actual facts of this case,” Christopher Thomas, Google’s lawyer, told judges. He said there should not have been a fine in the first place as existing case law showed that Google’s behavior was not anti-competitive while its market shares and the 13 countries where the infringement was committed did not justify the size of the multiplier. The Commission used a gravity multiplier between 5% and 20% to Google’s 2016 turnover in the 13 EU countries, higher than the 5% levied on Intel in 2009. EU laws allow for regulators to apply a multiplier of up to 30%. EU antitrust regulators should also have taken into account the company’s efforts to settle the case with concessions before they changed tack in 2015 and sanctioned Google, Thomas said. “Credit should be given for Google’s good faith attempts to find a solution to the Commission’s concerns with its three commitments offers and the almost 9 months engineering effort spent building that solution provisionally agreed with the Commission,” he said. Irish judge Colm Mac Eochaidh, one of the panel of five judges hearing the case and who had a day earlier said the company clearly committed an infraction, asked whether the size of the fine was as eye-catching as Google claimed. “You are one of the richest companies in the world,” he said, citing the example of someone with 120 euros and fined 2.4 euros for littering.  “Would you miss the 2.4 euros?” Mac Eochaidh also wondered about the power of the court to increase or revise fines, a thought which Google tried to squash by saying the Commission had not asked judges to do so.  The court in 2007 broke new ground by jacking up a cartel fine imposed by the Commission for the first time, leaving Germany’s BASF AG \u003cBASF.DE \u003e with a higher penalty. EU enforcers merely stuck to the rules when calculating the fine, Commission lawyer Anthony Dawes said. FILE PHOTO: File photo: The Google logo is seen at an event in Paris, France May 16, 2019. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo“The Commission scrupulously followed the methodology set out in the guidelines. Google’s conduct constituted a well established form of abuse,” he said. A ruling is expected next year and can be appealed to the Court of Justice, Europe’s highest. The case is T-612/17 Google and Alphabet v Commission.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Jet buyers back Boeing-Embraer deal as Airbus expands reach",
    "Content": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Some of the world’s biggest aircraft buyers are urging the European Union to clear Boeing’s tie-up with Embraer, fearing Embraer’s commercial aviation business would struggle on its own now Airbus has swallowed its main competitor in regional jets.   FILE PHOTO: An Embraer E-190 E2 aircraft featuring a spray painted tiger's face on the nose of the aircraft is displayed during a media preview of the Singapore Airshow February 4, 2018. REUTERS/Edgar Su/File PhotoAirbus (AIR.PA), Europe’s biggest planemaker, on Thursday increased its controlling stake in the A220 regional jet program - Embraer’s main rival - as Canada’s Bombardier (BBDb.TO) sold out of the project it had set up. That deal leaves Embraer looking increasingly exposed, despite its long history as an independent manufacturer, and ratchets up pressure on the Brazilian company and U.S. giant Boeing to complete a similar tie-up, buyers and analysts said. Their $4.2 billion deal would in part see Embraer (EMBR3.SA) cede 80% of its commercial arm to Boeing. It has been slowed by an EU competition probe expected to last until the end of April.  The EU is worried that whirlwind consolidation triggered by Bombardier’s decision to exit the market over losses would leave airlines too little choice, cutting the number of key suppliers from four to three, and then just two if Embraer is swallowed. But in an unusual twist - as buyers typically favor greater choice of suppliers - airlines and lessors contacted by Reuters backed the Boeing-Embraer deal, expressing fears whether Embraer would be able to offer an indefinite alternative to a jet now backed by a much larger manufacturer. “Now you have got the heavyweight boxer in the ring with someone who is about seven divisions lighter – there is only one outcome,” said Aengus Kelly, chief executive of leasing giant AerCap (AER.N), the world’s largest buyer of commercial planes. Kelly urged the European Commission to back the deal. “I think it’s a must: if Embraer don’t do it, it’s likely that Airbus will corner part of the narrowbody market which will be poor for the consumer,” he said in a telephone interview.   “It just won’t happen that Embraer is a viable long-term competitor, standalone, against the power of Airbus.” Embraer and Airbus had no immediate comment. Boeing (BA.N) declined to comment. The EU is expected to restart its probe into the Boeing-Embraer deal next week after halting the process while waiting for data, a person familiar with the matter said. ‘LET THE FREE MARKET RULE’ While the top planemakers have been severely tested by  crises over Boeing’s grounded 737 MAX and a bribery scandal at Airbus, their duopoly in the market for large jets is intact as evidenced by big displays at this week’s Singapore Airshow. Competing just below them in the market for 100-150-seat regional jets are the upgraded Embraer E2 family and all-new Bombardier CSeries, renamed A220 under Airbus.      The financial firepower required to develop a jet proved too much for Bombardier and accelerated matchmaking between Boeing and Embraer, which risks being left in the cold if it fails to come under Boeing’s wing, analysts said.  “They’d have a future, but it would get harder and harder to stay competitive as Airbus uses its muscle to lower A220 costs and prices,” said Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia. “That was always the problem for both smaller jet makers: they could never get costs in line with the big two, because they never had volume to negotiate aggressively with suppliers.  That’s changing for the A220, and must change for the E2. Otherwise, they’d lose market-share, profits, or both.” If he is worried, Embraer’s ebullient commercial aviation chief John Slattery was not giving anything away as he marketed the E195-E2 at the Singapore show. He declined to comment on the implications of the EU review beyond saying Embraer would cooperate.     But others say uncertainty over the fate of the Boeing deal leaves a sword hanging over the Brazilian planemaker. “It’s distracted running a process rather than a business. Let these two grown-up players work it out,” said Martin Moller, founder of the world’s largest regional aircraft lessor Nordic Aviation Capital, which owns or manages 175 Embraers. “Let the free market rule. My favorite airplane is the right plane for the mission,” he added. Though the Boeing-Embraer deal would cut the number of plane suppliers, airlines say the unique barriers to entry and winner-takes-all mentality of aviation mean playing off the two ultra-competitive industry giants in negotiations can lower prices to levels that standalone smaller competitors cannot match. “I prefer to have two players really competing than two and a half players failing to do so,” said Antonoaldo Neves, chief executive of airline TAP Portugal. Price is not the only factor. Credit costs, maintenance and performance guarantees are all likely to be better under Boeing than Embraer can offer by itself, Neves told Reuters. Not everyone agrees the deal should go ahead. Brazilian prosecutors on Thursday asked local regulators to reconsider their approval, citing omissions in the arguments.

    "Title": "Investors expect any T-Mobile/Sprint deal price haircut to be small",
    "Content": "(This Feb 11 story corrects reference to value of Sprint’s spectrum in paragraph 11) By Krystal Hu and Sheila Dang (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc may be limited in its ability to trim the price of its $40 billion acquisition of Sprint Corp after it overcame regulatory obstacles to completing the deal, investors and analysts said on Tuesday. The merger between the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers was agreed in April 2018, but was prevented from closing by U.S. states challenging it in court on antitrust grounds. A U.S. federal judge gave the companies the green light Tuesday to complete the deal. Before it is completed, T-Mobile’s German parent, Deutsche Telekom AG, plans to ask Sprint’s majority owner, Japan’s SoftBank Group, to agree to a lower price, arguing that Sprint’s fortunes have deteriorated following their agreement two years ago, sources told Reuters on Monday. However, investors are pricing in only a modest potential haircut. Sprint shares were trading at around $8.3 on Tuesday, a 14% discount to the $9.6 per share price that the all-stock deal with T-Mobile assigns Sprint. The market is assuming an approximately 9% cut to the deal price, Cowen analysts wrote in a research note on Monday after the companies’ shares soared on news that the merger could go ahead. T-Mobile has plenty of arguments it can deploy in a renegotiation with Sprint. The latter’s market share in subscribing phone customers is down from 12.4% at the start of 2018 to 11.8% in the third quarter of 2019, according to Cowen analysts, as it shed 400,000 customers. Meanwhile, its debt pile rose from $33 billion to $34.1 billion.  SoftBank’s prospects have also worsened, making it harder for it to walk away from a deal. The Japanese conglomerate is struggling to raise money from investors for its second $100 billion Vision Fund, as high-profile bets on start-ups such as WeWork backfired. Nevertheless, T-Mobile will likely be mindful about jeopardizing the deal with Sprint, because it needs the merger to take on bigger rivals Verizon Communications and AT\u0026T in the race for the development of next-generation wireless 5G technology, analysts said. “The only credible fallback is if T-Mobile says they’re willing to walk away, and I don’t think anyone would take them seriously,” said Craig Moffett, a telecom analyst at MoffettNathanson. The merger would form a wireless giant with 126 million customers and help T-Mobile in the race for 5G by utilizing Sprint’s valuable spectrum. It would also allow T-Mobile to save on costs by eliminating overlapping infrastructure.  Despite the decline in its business, the valuation of Sprint’s 2.5 GHz spectrum, a prime band for 5G deployment, has doubled to $25 billion from 2016 to 2019, analysts at JPMorgan estimate. Both Verizon and T-Mobile are short on spectrum amid growing usage, according to New Street Research analysts.  “The primary leverage Sprint has is that T-Mobile’s growth and pending launch of 5G makes that spectrum depth very important to T-Mobile,” said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at LightShed Partners. “I would not be shocked if there was no change in price, because it’s been such a lengthy process, and the demand for spectrum continues to rise.” T-Mobile said on Tuesday it expects the deal to close by April 1. Its executives have maintained on previous earnings calls the company hoped to close the deal in early 2020.  “A renegotiation won’t be easy, and by far the most important objective for both sides will be to close and move on to integrating,” said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research.

    "Title": "T-Mobile-Sprint merger wins approval from U.S. judge",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc’s edged closer to a takeover of Sprint Corp after a federal judge on Tuesday approved the deal, rejecting a claim by a group of states that said the proposed transaction would violate antitrust laws and raise prices. During a two-week trial in December, T-Mobile and Sprint argued the merger will better equip the new company to compete with top players Verizon Communications Inc and AT\u0026T Inc as the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier, creating a more efficient company with low prices and faster internet speeds. Shares of T-Mobile rose 11% to $94.01 while Sprint soared more than 74% to $8.34.  Finalizing a deal will be a boon to Japan’s Softbank Group Corp, Sprint’s controlling shareholder, as the conglomerate offloads a troubled asset that has lost subscribers at a faster rate and as it seeks to secure funding for a second Vision Fund.  During the trial, Sprint executives argued that the deal was a matter of survival.  Uniting T-Mobile’s low-band spectrum and Sprint’s mid-band spectrum could allow a faster roll-out of a national 5G network, the companies have said. Sprint and T-Mobile said in a statement that they would move to finalize the merger, which is still subject to closing conditions and possible additional court proceedings. FIERCE OPPOSITION The states, led by California and New York, had said the deal would reduce competition, leading to higher prices. “The merger of T-Mobile and Sprint will create another telecommunications behemoth in an already dangerously consolidated market,” U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote on Tuesday.   Related CoverageInvestors expect any T-Mobile/Sprint deal price haircut to be smallNY attorney general considers appealing ruling OK'ing Sprint T-Mobile mergerThe decision by U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero clears the path for the deal, which already has federal approval and was originally valued at $26 billion. Judge Marrero said he based his decision on three essential points. The first was that he was not persuaded by the states that the deal would lead to higher prices or lower-quality wireless services.  He disagreed that Sprint would remain a strong competitor and was unconvinced that DISH Network Corp, which is buying divested assets from the deal, would fail to live up to its promises to enter and compete in the wireless market. “The court concludes that the proposed merger is not reasonably likely to substantially lessen competition,” Judge Marrero wrote, adding that he was confident in DISH’s ability to transform into a “disruptive maverick” in the wireless industry. The states maintained that Dish was ill-equipped to become a competitive fourth wireless carrier, noting that it lacks experience, scale and brand recognition in wireless.  New York’s attorney general said the state is considering an appeal; California’s attorney general said that state is “prepared to fight.” Rani Habash, a partner at the law firm Dechert LLP who specializes in antitrust, said the states would have difficulty winning an appeal. The judge “found the Sprint and T-Mobile side to be more credible for their prediction of the future,” he said. “When you have a factual determination, that’s very hard to overcome.” A spokesman for the California Public Utilities Commission, the last regulatory body to decide on the merger, said its review of the deal is expected to conclude in July. The judge’s decision to let the deal proceed drew criticism from some antitrust experts. “If this merger is not anticompetitive, even with the remedies agreed to, it is hard to know what is,” said Eleanor Fox, trade regulation and antitrust law professor at New York University. A smartphones with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/IllustrationThe U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some prepaid assets to satellite provider Dish, which would create its own cellular network to ensure there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October in a vote split 3-2 along party lines. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said the ruling was a big win for American consumers and would help ensure U.S. leadership in rolling out a 5G network.

    "Title": "Google seals takeover of Looker after UK green light",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: The logo of Google is seen in Davos, Switzerland Januar 20, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo(Reuters) - Alphabet Inc-owned Google said on Thursday it has completed its $2.6 billion buyout of privately held big-data analytics firm Looker Data Sciences after winning clearance from Britain’s competition watchdog. Google announced the cash deal in June, the first major acquisition for its new cloud business Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kurian. The deal aims to build upon the success of Google Cloud’s BigQuery, a tool for managing large datasets. Looker’s tool enables analysts and other workers to define calculations for items such as revenue or high-value customers and then visualize trends in their data without writing complicated scripts. It competes with Tableau Software Inc, Domo Inc and Microsoft’s Power BI. The Competition and Markets Authority said its probe found the deal would not adversely impact quality of service or competition in the market for data analytics tools and software. The CMA added that the deal was unlikely to lead to increased prices or lower quality as the two are not considered close competitors by businesses who use business intelligence tools as they can choose from other providers including Microsoft, Oracle, Tableau, SAP and IBM. Google’s cloud computing division is a distant third globally to Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in terms of revenue from renting infrastructure and other computing tools to businesses.   “Although Google had the ability to make it difficult for rivals to access the Google-generated data they need from online advertising and web analytics services, there was no strong evidence they would have the incentive to do this,” the CMA found. The deal has also been approved by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Austrian Federal Competition Authority. “We believe we will be uniquely positioned to address the data analytics and business intelligence demands of even more enterprises globally, across all industries,” said Kurian in a statement announcing the completion of the acquisition.

    "Content": "FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp’s steel division swung to a loss in the first quarter, raising doubts over Europe’s second-biggest steelmaker, the conglomerate’s core following its planned sale of its elevator business. FILE PHOTO: German steelmaker Thyssenkrupp AG CEO Martina Merz walks on stage during the annual shareholders meeting in Bochum, Germany, January 31, 2020.  REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File PhotoImports from China and weak demand from the car industry have pummeled steelmakers across the continent, including German rival Salzgitter (SZGG.DE) and the local division of India’s Tata Steel (TISC.NS). Thyssenkrupp’s loss highlights the challenges it will face in revamping the business, which, along with materials trading, will be the backbone of Thyssenkrupp once the sale of its elevator business is decided at the end of the month. “The latest figures are not great. But we are convinced that we are on the right track,” CEO Martina Merz said in a statement.  Restructuring efforts at the steel division, including 2,000 job cuts, are currently under way. The division posted an adjusted operating loss of 164 million euros in the first quarter versus a profit of 38 million a year earlier, blaming a “significant drop in demand from the auto industry”. Shares in the group were indicated 1.7% lower in pre-market trade. Pressured by a sector-wide shift toward electric cars, the auto industry has been hit by a raft of profit warnings, with suppliers, including Thyssenkrupp, hit as a result. The auto industry is Thyssenkrupp single biggest client group. Cash from a sale of the elevator business, which is valued at 16-17 billion euros, will therefore be much needed.

Merz said a decision on the elevator deal was imminent. The group’s equity ratio fell to 5.4% from 6.1% for the 2018/19 financial year, indicating that virtually all of the group’s assets are backed by debt.

    "Title": "Competition heats up in turboprop market",
    "Content": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Competition is cranking up in the world of turboprops. FILE PHOTO: An airport worker examines a flybe aircraft before it takes off from Liverpool John Lennon Airport in Liverpool northern England, May 19 , 2016. REUTERS/Phil NobleFor years turboprops were an ignored corner of the aircraft industry, accounting for about 120 aircraft a year compared with the more than 1,000 jets made by giants Airbus and Boeing. But growing rivalries in the turboprop business cut through a Singapore Airshow depleted by coronavirus this week. While intercontinental jet travel is vulnerable to trade wars and disruptions such as epidemics, regional development in archipelago nations like Indonesia is favouring the turboprop.  The market has been dominated for years by Europe’s ATR, jointly owned by Airbus (AIR.PA) and Italy’s Leonardo (LDOF.MI), which enjoys a relatively undisturbed lion’s share of the market with a small slice also held by the Canadian-owned De Havilland Dash 8. But the commercial arm of Brazil’s Embraer (EMBR3.SA) is sharpening a pitch to return to the market and Chief Executive John Slattery told Reuters he expected a decision by the end of the year. “We should be positioned in the mid-to-late fourth quarter to bring a business case with a recommendation to our board,” he said in an interview. In a sign that the development is accelerating, Slattery said he had held talks with three potential engine suppliers - Rolls-Royce (RR.L), General Electric (GE.N) and Pratt \u0026 Whitney Canada, part of the engine unit of United Technologies (UTX.N). “We are fully engaged with engine manufacturers now and meeting here at the air show...We are excited by where we are.” Until now, planemakers have found it difficult to justify the estimated $2-4 billion investment needed to develop a new turboprop, despite its efficiency on relatively short flights. The market has been stagnant at about 120 deliveries a year and demand for the planes is dependent on volatile oil prices, with turboprops displacing small jets when prices are high. The thrumming noise of the propellor-driven turboprop also puts some passengers off, travel experts say, even though many in the industry say that reputation is already out of date. Slattery said quiet new engine technology and advances in passenger comfort would stimulate demand. “We believe the market opportunity going forward is significantly different to what past decades have shown.” COMPETITION BOOST China has already entered the fray with its planned MA700. At ATR’s bright-red stand inside Singapore’s exhibition hall, Chief Executive Stefano Bortoli shrugged off the threat of a comeback by Embraer which already makes smaller turboprops. “I think once Embraer will let us know their decision you will have our comments. At this point in time it is simply commenting on opinions. Not that we will stand still,” he said. The fundamental shape of the two-aircraft ATR family seating 40-78 people has not changed in about 30 years, but the aircraft was modernised with the -600 variant around a decade ago. ATR recently launched a freighter and a version designed for use on short runways, which has opened opportunities in markets such as Japan and Papua New Guinea, where PNG Air emerged as a launch customer this week. “The approach we’ve taken...is let’s consolidate the platform that we have...and when the right time comes and there are solid options available, let’s go for that,” Bortoli said. ATR shareholders have clashed in the past about whether to launch a bigger new 90-seater, with Toulouse-based Airbus blocking the investment. But industry analysts say ATR would have to consider responding to a new plane from Embraer. The prospect of greater competition in turboprop adds zest to efforts by Embraer to complete a tie up with Boeing (BA.N), which has agreed to acquire control of its commercial division. The European Commission has extended its scrutiny of the $4 billion deal, fearing that it would narrow options for airlines. FILE PHOTO: Groundcrew prepare a Liat airlines ATR 42-600 plane on the tarmac at Barbados’ Grantley Adams International Airport in Barbados, March 18, 2019. REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo Slattery reiterated Embraer would only have the appetite to invest in a new turboprop in the context of the Boeing venture. He declined to elaborate but industry experts say it is a signal to Europe that the Boeing deal would improve choice for airlines by prompting ATR to come up with its own new product. One European source said it remained doubtful whether Boeing would support a new turboprop once it gained control of Embraer, but analysts note the U.S. planemaker has not yet ruled it out.

    "Title": "Airbus, Quebec to buy out Bombardier's A220 stake",
    "Content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has teamed up with the Quebec government to buy Bombardier’s 33.5% stake in the A220 passenger jet program, completing the Canadian firm’s exit from civil aviation and boosting Airbus’s position in a new battleground with Boeing.  FILE PHOTO: An Airbus A220-300 aircraft flies during its unveiling in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, July 10, 2018. Airbus A220 is the new brand for the small CSeries passenger jet acquired from Canada's Bombardier. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File PhotoUnder the terms of Thursday’s deal, Airbus’s (AIR.PA) stake in the A220 program - known as Airbus Canada - increases to 75% from 50.1%, while Quebec’s holding rises to 25%. In taking the larger holdings, the European aerospace group and Canadian province will be assuming Bombardier’s BBDd.TO share of A220 ramp-up costs, while Bombardier will receive $591 million net of adjustments. The deal will secure more than 3,300 Airbus jobs in Quebec, the companies added. The A220, previously known as the CSeries, is a 110-130 seater aircraft, targeted at regional aviation markets and a little smaller than Airbus’s mainstay A320 jet.  The European group’s move into that smaller market has been mirrored by U.S. rival Boeing’s (BA.N) planned tie-up with Brazilian regional jet manufacturer Embraer (EMBR3.SA) and opens a new front in the battle between the two planemaking giants.  Bombardier said the sale would help the company - which faced a cash crunch in 2015 - to improve its financial position. Bombardier on Thursday reported a quarterly loss. “This transaction supports our efforts to address our capital structure and completes our strategic exit from commercial aerospace,” President and Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said. The deal also postpones until 2026 the agreed date when Airbus can buy out Quebec’s stake in the A220 program, three years later than originally planned. The province increased its stake for “no cash consideration”, the companies said, in return for its bigger share of the funding burden. Sources have told Reuters that Bombardier’s rail unit may also be sold to French group Alstom (ALSO.PA), although any deal has yet to be finalised. Montreal-based Bombardier ceded control of the A220 program to Airbus in 2018 for a token C$1 as part of broader efforts to improve its finances. Airbus announced the increase in its stake in the program alongside a hefty 2019 net loss due to one-off costs.

    "Title": "Google's fight against EU antitrust fine comes up against critical judge",
    "Content": "LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Google’s battle against a $2.6 billion EU antitrust fine was dealt an apparent setback on Thursday, when one of the judges hearing the case said the company had committed a “clear infraction” in its handling of price-comparison shopping services. FILE PHOTO: File photo: The Google logo is seen at an event in Paris, France May 16, 2019. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File PhotoThe comments by Colm Mac Eochaidh, one of the panel of five judges, came on day two of a three-day hearing at Europe’s General Court - its second highest - as Google (GOOGL.O) seeks to overturn the first of a trio of EU antitrust penalties. In its 2017 decision to impose a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.6 billion) fine, the European Commission said the world’s biggest internet search engine unfairly favoured its own price-comparison shopping service over smaller European rivals. Irish judge Mac Eochaidh concurred. “For me, this case really is visibility. This is a very important point in the case. It is perfectly apparent what has happened is this: you have promoted your own service and demoted that of others,” he said. “That is a clear infraction.” Mac Eochaidh repeatedly asked Google what it had refused to supply to its competitors that had forced them to air their grievances to EU enforcers. Google’s lawyer Christopher Thomas faulted the Commission for not taking Amazon (AMZN.O) into account when defining the market for assessing the competitive harm caused by Google’s practices.  Regulators were right to discount Amazon’s role, said Thomas Hoppner, lawyer for several German complainants. “Merchant platforms and CSSs (comparison shopping services) simply cater to different needs of different types of online retailers. These different needs mean that CSSs cannot easily be transformed into merchant platforms and vice versa,” he said. “The entire Google story that the condemned conduct was a means to compete with Amazon has no merits.”  Judges are expected to issue their ruling next year, which can be appealed to the Court of Justice, Europe’s highest.

    "Title": "Factbox: Nestle CEO Schneider's top deals",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider has made great strides in positioning the world’s largest food company for the future with his aggressive deal-making since taking over in January 2017. Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider talks during a news conference at the company headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, February 13, 2020. REUTERS/Pierre AlbouyThe 54-year-old German-American has set a vision on selling premium products in fast-growing categories such as pet food and coffee while disposing of businesses in slower-growth areas such as chocolate and processed meat.   Schneider promised to replace as much as 10% of Nestle's existing portfolio by the end of 2020 and has conducted more than 50 transactions and reviews since he took the helm. (reut.rs/34b1H2z) In October Schneider indicated he would not stop at the 10% target, describing the portfolio review as an “ongoing process”. Below is a summary of the top deals under Schneider’s tenure:  2020:  * January - Nestle expands its medical nutrition portfolio with the acquisition of Zenpep from Allergan. Zenpep is a medication for people who have a pancreas that is unable to provide sufficient enzymes to properly digest fats, proteins and sugars. * February - Nestle’s health science arm invests an additional $200 million in Aimmune Therapeutics after the drugmaker won U.S. approval for its peanut allergy therapy. 2019: * May - Sells its skin health unit, maker of the Cetaphil and Proactiv skincare brands, to private equity firm EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.1 billion). The business accounted for about 3% of group sales.   * December - Agrees a $4 billion sale to Froneri of its U.S. ice-cream business, which includes Haagen-Daazs. Froneri is Nestle’s ice-cream joint venture with private equity firm PAI Partners.      * December - Nestle agrees to sell a majority stake in its packaged meat business, Herta, to family-run Spanish company Casa Tarradellas to create a joint venture in which it would hold a 40% stake. 2018: * January - Sells its U.S. confectionary business to Ferrero for $2.8 billion, handing over control of brands Butterfinger, Crunch and Baby Ruth to the Italian manufacturer. The deal marked Schneider's first big sale, underlining the shift in focus toward healthier products. (reut.rs/2snYMX2) * May - Strikes $7.2 billion licensing deal here with Starbucks for exclusive rights to sell the U.S. chain’s packaged coffees and teas around the world, tying a premium brand to Nestle’s global distribution muscle's. The contract includes Starbucks-branded capsules for Nestle's Nespresso and Dolce Gusto single-serve brewers. * September - Sells its Gerber Life Insurance business here to Western and Southern Financial Group for $1.55 billion in cash. The insurer, which sold life cover for families and juveniles, had sales of $856 million in 2017, equating ot less than 1% of group sales that year.  2017: * September - Nestle acquires majority interest in California-based coffee roaster Blue Bottle Coffee here its first step into the fast-growing, super-premium coffee shop segment. * September - Agrees to buy California-based Sweet Earth here the plant-based foods manufacturer behind the Awesome burger, for an undisclosed sum. * December - Signs a $2.3 billion deal here to buy privately held Atrium Innovations, a Canadian vitamin maker, from a group of investors led by Permira Funds. The cash deal gives Nestle exposure to the consumer healthcare category.

    "Title": "Australia court approves $10 billion Vodafone-TPG merger, overrules regulator",
    "Content": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian court approved a A$15 billion ($10.1 billion) merger between a unit of Britain’s Vodafone Group (VOD.L) and internet provider TPG Telecom (TPM.AX) on Thursday, overruling a regulator and enabling a huge rival to the country’s top telcos. A woman holds her phone as she walks past an advertisement for Australia's TPG Telecom Ltd in central Sydney, Australia, April 12, 2017.      REUTERS/Steven Saphore A Federal Court judge said a tie-up between Vodafone’s joint venture with local telco Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Ltd (HTA.AX) and TPG would not harm competition, rejecting the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) reason for blocking the deal last year. The ruling revives a plan to challenge the dominance of Telstra Corp Ltd (TLS.AX) and Singapore Telecommunications’s (STEL.SI) Optus in the Australian market by giving TPG, an internet company, and Vodafone, a mobile phone company, access to each other’s sizeable nationwide networks. The regulator has a month to lodge an appeal. TPG had been looking for a way into the highly-anticipated 5G mobile market - where Vodafone is gearing up to compete - after halting construction of its own network due to an Australian ban on parts supplied by China’s Huawei Industries. “This merger...gives a lot more certainty that there will be a strong 5G player in the market. We have confirmation we’ll have three 5G players,” Vodafone Hutchison Australia CEO Iñaki Berroeta said on a call with analysts. TPG founder and Executive Chairman David Teoh said in a statement the company was “very pleased with the Federal Court decision” although it still needed shareholder and other regulatory approvals. Shares of Hutchison surged as much as a quarter, while TPG shares gained 11%. Shares of Telstra, which dominates the Australian mobile and internet markets, had risen earlier on Thursday after it released its half-year earnings but fell up to 2.4% after the court ruling. SingTel’s Singapore-listed shares were down 1.2%. Related CoverageFactbox: Vodafone-TPG merger advances in Australia after hiccupsThe ruling was “consistent with our expectations and we’d already factored in a successful merger”, Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. REGULATOR REBUFF The ruling is a blow to the ACCC which has had decisions to block some of the country’s biggest M\u0026A deals of recent years overturned by courts, including the TPG-Vodafone deal. “Australian consumers have lost a once-in-a-generation opportunity for stronger competition and cheaper mobile telecommunications services with this merger now allowed to proceed,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. Sims added the regulator was considering the judgment. The ACCC had argued TPG may yet build a 5G network - without Huawei parts - if it had no other option. TPG had ruled out revisiting the network on grounds that other parts suppliers were too expensive. Speaking on a call with analysts to discuss earnings, which was held at the same time as the court ruling, Telstra CEO Andy Penn declined to comment on the effects of competition with TPG in the 5G market. “Frankly, it’s an already incredibly, an intensely competitive market,” Penn said. Slideshow (2 Images)Murray King, chief financial officer of SingTel-owned Optus, said on an earnings call the company would “see how the merged entity looks to drive their operations and how they go to market”. “We think we are well-placed but we don’t take competition lightly,” he said.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Thyssenkrupp-Kone elevator merger would trigger legal war - Schindler",
    "Content": "FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Swiss elevator maker Schindler (SCHP.S) would embark on an all-out antitrust offensive in the courts to stall any deal to combine Thyssenkrupp’s (TKAG.DE) lift division with rival Kone (KNEBV.HE), board member Alfred Schindler told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: Thyssenkrupp's elevator test tower is pictured in Rottweil, Germany, January 21, 2020. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/File PhotoHis comments came a day after the deadline for bids for Thyssenkrupp Elevator, with Finland’s Kone and three private equity consortia vying to buy it in a deal sources say could be worth up to 17 billion euros ($18.6 billion). A Kone-Thyssenkrupp Elevator merger would create the world’s biggest lift maker, leapfrogging market leader Otis, owned by United Technologies (UTX.N), and Schindler in second place. “We would probably file lawsuits in Europe, the United States, Canada, China and possibly Australia. These cases would take at least three to four years,” said Schindler, who is now chairman emeritus of the company he ran for 26 years. He said other rivals would probably take legal action too: “You can safely assume that neither Otis nor Schindler will simply accept being driven out.” Thyssenkrupp and Otis declined to comment. A Kone spokeswoman said the company continued to believe there was room for consolidation in the sector. Shares in Kone fell as much as 3.9% following Schindler’s comments to Reuters while Thyssenkrupp rose slightly. Once a symbol of Germany’s industrial power, Thyssenkrupp is struggling with 12.4 billion euros of debt and pension liabilities after years of ill-fated investments and needs to raise money from its prized elevator division to restructure. Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board is due to meet on Feb. 27 and a decision on the fate of the elevator business could be made then, two people familiar with the matter said. Besides selling all or part of the business, Thyssenkrupp is also considering an initial public offering, though sources said this option was less likely. Solely based on bids, Kone and a consortium of Blackstone (BX.N), Carlyle (CG.O) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board look best-placed to reach the final round but no decision has been made, the people said. Kone has made a non-binding bid of 17 billion euros while the consortium has offered about 16 billion. It was not clear whether Kone had improved its earlier offer. RULES OF WAR A consortium comprising Advent, Cinven [CINV.UL] and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and an alliance between Canada’s Brookfield (BAMa.TO) and Singapore’s Temasek [TEM.UL] are also in the running, sources have said. While a sale to Kone would probably raise the most cash for Thyssenkrupp, the beleaguered conglomerate is concerned it could trigger antitrust investigations where the combined company would be a major player, such as Europe and the United States.  \"Such a hypothetical takeover would ... have considerable effects on the structure of the relevant markets and most likely lead to significant negative impacts on effective competition in many markets,\" DICE Consult said in a report here Kone has drawn up plans to hand Thyssenkrupp’s European assets to private equity firm CVC [CVC.UL] but the European Commission typically prefers industrial buyers that can compete better with the firm offloading assets. Powerful labor unions, who control half of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board, oppose any breakup of the business as well as antitrust reviews. “What Thyssenkrupp needs now is high transaction certainty for the remaining group, not hanging in the balance for 1 to 2 years,” said Knut Giesler of IG Metall, Germany’s largest union, and vice chairman of Thyssenkrupp Elevator’s supervisory board. Kone is the world’s third biggest elevator maker, followed by Thyssenkrupp and Japan’s Hitachi (6501.T). Schindler was the Swiss firm’s CEO from 1985 until 2011 and his views carry significant weight as the Schindler and Bonnard families, and related parties, hold 71.1% of the voting rights. Slideshow (3 Images)Schindler, who transformed the company into a global player, said it would also intensify its operational efforts to fight a combined Kone and Thyssenkrupp. “There will be a technology war. It is already ongoing but it will intensify massively,” he said, without giving specifics. “Surprise lies at the heart of any defense strategy. A strategy that you lay out in advance would go against any rule of warfare.” Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze and Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and Foo Yun Chee in Brussels; Editing by David ClarkeOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Alstom board to discuss buying Bombardier rail unit: sources",
    "Content": "PARIS/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Alstom’s (ALSO.PA) board will meet late on Wednesday to discuss buying Bombardier’s (BBDb.TO) rail unit, sources familiar with the matter said, and a media report said the French train maker had valued the business at just under $7 billion. The logo of Alstom is seen on the company's TGV high-speed train factory in Belfort, France, February 6, 2019. REUTERS/Vincent KesslerFrench TV station BFM reported on its website that Alstom was set to make a firm offer for Bombardier’s Berlin-based rail division. Three industry sources familiar with the talks said a deal would involve Alstom acquiring Bombardier’s largest unit in terms of revenue, but cautioned an agreement was not finalized.  Bombardier shares were up almost 8% in afternoon trading. Alstom and Bombardier declined to comment. A deal would help Montreal-based Bombardier improve its financial footing. The company, which will report its results on Thursday, faces higher-than-expected-costs in its rail division and $9.7 billion in outstanding debt, according to Refinitiv data.  An acquisition would help Alstom compete more effectively against Chinese giant CRRC Corp and in the U.S. market, a fourth industry source said. (601766.SS) Desjardins analyst Benoit Poirier said in a note to clients that a $7 billion offer seemed high “considering recent operational challenges” in the rail unit. A planned tie-up between Alstom and Germany’s Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) collapsed last year due to European regulatory concerns. “After the failure of the Alstom-Siemens merger, (a deal) would be a good strategic rebound for Alstom,” said a fourth source who was familiar with the French government’s thinking. Bombardier’s rail assets are heavy in lower-margin rolling stock which are less attractive for Alstom, the source noted, but the deal would still offer synergies. Alstom had recently made a non-binding offer valuing the business at $7 billion and a new offer would be binding but worth less, BFM said. Alstom would offer cash for Bombardier’s 70% stake of its railway business and Alstom shares for the 30% held by Canadian pension fund manager Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the report added.  Poirier of Desjardins said he assumed a value of $2.5 billion net of Caisse’s stake in the division, but excluding “pension liabilities which could be significant.” Caisse, which acquired the stake for $1.5 billion in 2016, declined comment. One of the industry sources told Reuters that several options were on the table, including Alstom raising capital and the Caisse becoming one of the French company’s main shareholders with Bouygues (BOUY.PA), a French conglomerate that owns a 15% stake in Alstom. Bombardier is also weighing a sale of either its business jet or rail division. The company is leaning toward selling rail because it would resolve the need to buy back the Caisse’s share at a high cost, the second industry source said.  Under their agreement, Bombardier could buy back Caisse’s convertible shares at either the fair market value of its stake, or at a minimum 15% compounded annual return, whichever is higher.  Reuters reported last month that Bombardier had approached Alstom and Japan’s Hitachi to find a merger partner for its rail business.

    "Title": "Google says EU antitrust regulators holding back innovation",
    "Content": "LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Google defended its business model on Wednesday, saying that making innovative products was at its core rather than helping rivals, as it sought to overturn a 2.4-billion-euro ($2.6 billion) EU antitrust fine at Europe’s second-highest court. The legal fight comes as European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager gears up to take on U.S. tech giants and Chinese companies with legislation in the coming months, on top of ongoing antitrust investigations. “Competition law does not require Google to hold back innovation or compromise its quality to accommodate rivals. Otherwise, competition would be restricted and innovation would be stifled,” the company’s lawyer Thomas Graf told a panel of five judges on the first of a three-day hearing at the General Court. “The decision’s case is, at its core, that Google should not have introduced these innovations, unless it gave competing CSSs (comparison shopping services) the same access,” Graf said, laying out the arguments for the world’s most popular internet search engine in a decade-long battle with the European Commission over its business practices. The company did not favor its own service but competed on its merits, he said. The EU competition enforcer handed the fine to Google in 2017 for favoring its own price-comparison shopping service against those of smaller European rivals.  Two further decisions for different issues since then have lifted the total penalty to 8.25 billion euros, four times more than Microsoft’s (MSFT.O) EU fines of 2.2 billion euros. Commission lawyer Nicholas Khan swatted away Google’s arguments, saying this was a clear case of a company using its dominance to give itself an advantage in other markets. “What Google engaged in was leveraging conduct of the type found to be abusive many times under EU competition law. Conceptually, there is nothing esoteric about this case,” he told the judges. He criticized Google for cherry picking elements of the EU decision to challenge. “It is as if Google has applied a ranking algorithm to the decision and decided that parts of it just aren’t relevant,” Khan said. Lawyer Thomas Vinje for British price-comparison shopping service Foundem, whose complaint triggered the EU investigation, said Google’s product would never have gained prominence if Google had treated it the same way as rival products. “But instead of being prone to being demoted, Google’s comparison-shopping service is systematically promoted to the most visible spots in Google’s search results,” he said. Tech lobbying group CCIA, which backs Google, said enforcers should be careful they do not nip innovation in the bud. FILE PHOTO: The brand logo of Alphabet Inc's Google is seen outside its office in Beijing, China August 8, 2018.  REUTERS/Thomas Peter“There will be less innovation, and a worse outcome for consumers, if tech companies are disincentivized from improving their websites or adding new features,” CCIA lawyer James Killick said. Judges will rule in the coming months.  The case is T-612/17 Google and Alphabet v Commission.

    "Title": "JPMorgan picked as adviser for sale of stake in $7.3 billion Turkish motorway: sources",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A J.P. Morgan logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File PhotoLONDON/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) has been picked as an adviser for the sale of a stake in a $7.3 billion motorway in Turkey, four sources familiar with the matter said. Billed as a landmark project in the financing of infrastructure schemes involving the government and the private sector in Turkey, the final section of the 426 km-long Gebze-Orhangazi-Izmir motorway was inaugurated last year to link Istanbul in the northwest to the western port city of Izmir. Construction consortium Otoyol AS said in late January last year that it had started seeking international advisers to value the project ahead of a possible stake sale. One of the sources, who had direct knowledge of the matter, said the total value of the sale depended on interest from potential buyers. JPMorgan declined to comment, while Otoyol did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Italian contractor Astaldi (AST.MI), which has a stake of just under 19% in the project, has been hard hit by a downturn in Italy’s construction industry and is under a creditor protection scheme. It has already agreed to sell its 33% stake in the third Bosphorus Bridge to its Turkish partner, a move aimed to help the Italian builder complete a rescue plan.       Turkish firms Nurol Insaat, Özaltin and Makyol each hold a 26.98% stake in the consortium while Göçay, another Turkish company, has a 0.2% share in the consortium, according to their filings. The joint venture was awarded a 22-year and four month build, operate, transfer contract in 2009, a model used to finance large-scale infrastructure schemes where the government grants a concession to private firms to finance, build and operate a project. Total investment in the project was $7.3 billion, including $5 billion from debt, $1.5 billion from equity and $800 million from operational revenues, according to the consortium’s website.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: Signage for Sainsbury's is seen at a branch of the supermarket in London, Britain, January 8, 2020. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File PhotoLONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L) said on Wednesday that Roger Davis, chairman of its poorly performing banking division, will step down. A search to replace Davis, who has chaired the bank for nearly seven years, will begin and a further announcement regarding timings of his retirement and news of his successor will be made in due course, it said. The announcement comes five months after Sainsbury’s completed a strategic review of its financial services business, which made an underlying operating profit of just 20 million pounds ($26 million) in the six months to August 31. At its capital markets day in September, Sainsbury’s detailed a plan to double the division’s underlying profit within five years.  It stopped mortgage sales and said it would not inject any more group capital into the division after 35 million pounds in the first half of its 2019-20 year. Sainsbury’s said last month that Simon Roberts, currently retail and operations director, will succeed group Chief Executive Mike Coupe in June. Given its performance, Sainsbury’s Bank is unpopular with investors and some analysts have speculated that a new group CEO may not retain it in its current shape despite the recent strategy change.

    "Title": "FTC demands data on small buys by Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft",
    "Content": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Concerned that big tech companies are unfairly engaging in potential anti-competitive behavior, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday it ordered Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google unit, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to provide information on mergers that were too small to report to antitrust regulators. FILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are seen in a combination photo from Reuters files.    REUTERS/File Photos/File PhotoThe queries come as the Justice Department, the FTC, state attorneys general and the House Judiciary Committee are investigating the big tech platforms, which are accused of unfairly using their clout to defend market share or expand into adjacent markets. Much of the criticism has focused on massive deals such as Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram and Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods, but the companies also have spent billions on smaller companies, dramatically changing the competitive landscape in emerging tech sectors.  FTC Chairman Joseph Simons said notices being issued to Big Tech companies were intended for research but could lead to enforcement action. “If during the study we see that there are transactions that are problematic ... we could go back and initiate enforcement action to deal with those transactions,” said Simons. The notices were not meant to be a warning to the companies but were designed to identify areas that need more antitrust enforcement, he added.  The FTC will study “hundreds” of acquisitions made by the companies and aims to finish its study “quickly,” agency officials said. “It depends what they do with it,” said Matt Stoller, research director at the American Economic Liberties Project and a vocal critic of big tech companies. “I’m not going to say this is good until they do something that impacts power.” Google, Amazon.com, Apple and Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “We look forward to working with the FTC to answer their questions,” a Microsoft spokesman said. The agency asked for information about deals that were done between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2019, and require each company to identify transactions that were too small to report to the FTC and Justice Department, which assess mergers for compliance with antitrust law. The tech giants have come under fire from both sides of the political spectrum, with Republicans irked by what they say is a stifling of conservative voices on social media and Democrats angered by increasing consolidation. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for president, has explicitly urged federal regulators to undo “anti-competitive mergers,” including Amazon’s purchases of Whole Foods and Zappos, Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google’s acquisitions of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick. Paul Holland, a general partner at Foundation Capital, said big tech players’ frequent purchases of start-ups have been a double-edged sword. “They’ve created a true marketplace for startups. They’ve created a destination for them,” he said. But Holland added that the limited number of potential acquirers has also created an “oligopolistic competitive environment” for those sales. Facebook acquired dozens of companies between 2010 and 2019, according to S\u0026P Global Market Intelligence data, including eye-catching purchases like WhatsApp and Instagram as well as smaller transactions in ad tech, facial recognition and social analytics. Alphabet spent $1 billion on an unspecified number of small acquisitions in 2019, according to securities filings. Many were companies working on artificial intelligence research and cloud computing services, areas in which Google is trying to innovate quickly and has sought to bolster hiring. With the exception of its $3 billion purchase of headphone and streaming company Beats in 2014, Apple has mostly made small deals valued at less than $500 million over the past decade, snapping up small companies working on key technologies such as augmented reality displays, camera sensors and artificial intelligence software. In fiscal 2019, Microsoft made 19 small acquisitions for $1.6 billion, mostly in cash. Microsoft has sought to consolidate its position in the business software market, with major acquisitions such as the LinkedIn social network for business professionals and the code repository site GitHub. Since buying LinkedIn, which also fielded offers from Salesforce Inc (CRM.N), Microsoft has begun integrating its social network data with Microsoft products such as Outlook email.

    "Content": "HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bankers in Asia are bracing for a deal drought as efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus epidemic have put key meetings and roadshows on hold. FILE PHOTO: A woman wearing a face mask crosses a road after the extended Lunar New Year holiday caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak, in Beijing's central business district, China February 10, 2020. REUTERS/Stringer/File PhotoSeveral auctions of assets are facing delays or re-assessments and preparations for potential Chinese initial public offerings (IPOs) are also slowing, bankers said. “All our deals are on hold now - capital markets or M\u0026A. Nothing is happening,” said a Hong Kong-based senior investment banker with a Wall Street bank. Baring Private Equity Asia is expected to extend a bidding deadline for the sale of HCP, a Shanghai-based packaging business valued at around $1 billion, said four people with knowledge of the deal. The Hong Kong-based investment firm sent out teasers before Chinese New Year and was initially expecting bids to come in as soon as this month, they said. Baring declined to comment and HCP did not respond to a query for comment. The launch of a sale process of Eu Yan Sang International, a Singapore-based healthcare company specializing in Chinese medicine, is likely to be postponed, said two people aware of the matter. They said the company had hoped to value itself at more than $500 million. The sale of the company, partly owned by a unit of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and with a significant chunk of its business in Hong Kong, is being pushed back as most of its targeted buyers are Chinese, these people said. Responding to a Reuters query, Eu Yan Sang’s Group CEO Aaron Boey said in a statement late on Tuesday the company did not comment on “rumors”, adding it was focused on “executing our strategies and enhancing shareholder value” during these extremely challenging times. Temasek declined comment. “Any China-related deals are off, so that means Q1 is probably washed out. European and U.S. buyers are also worried about traveling to Asia,” said a Singapore-based banker. Major banks in Hong Kong and Singapore have restricted travel to mainland China and are allowing staff to work from home while moving others to different office locations. A number of countries have reduced or canceled flights in and out of China while Singapore and Hong Kong have demanded people returning from China quarantine themselves for up to 14 days. The virus has claimed more than 1,000 lives and has spread to 24 other countries and territories. The bankers declined to be identified because the transactions are confidential. LESSONS FROM SARS During the 2003 SARS epidemic, the volume of China-related IPOs fell 25% in the first half of the year compared with 2002, while M\u0026A volumes halved, according to Refinitiv data. The epidemic ended in July 2003. China has become a far bigger factor for both markets since then, accounting for 55% of M\u0026A and 66% of IPO activity in Asia-Pacific over the past four years, compared with an average 16% and 50% in 2003. Another factor that will concern investors in IPOs is the potential for a company’s outlook to worsen because of the epidemic, bankers and lawyers said. “The most significant adverse impacts, as of today, are the ability of IPO candidates and the reporting accountants to get their financials prepared and audited and for advisers to conduct on-site due diligence given the disruption to regional travel,” said Michael Jacobs, a partner at law firm Allen \u0026 Overy. Buyout firm Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O) has delayed the U.S. IPO of its German specialty chemicals group Atotech, concerned that the coronavirus outbreak would hurt its valuation, Reuters reported last week. While video conferencing is making it easier to hold meetings than during the SARS outbreak, dealmakers expect the drought to last for weeks to come. “Over the next few weeks, nothing much is expected to come to the markets in this environment - on both the M\u0026A and IPO side. I’m trying to focus on other deals where there’s hardly any China involvement,” said a banker based in Hong Kong.

    "Title": "SoftBank stock surges to seven-month high after judge OKs Sprint-T-Mobile merger",
    "Content": "TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) stock surged to its highest price in over half a year in Tokyo on Wednesday, after a U.S. federal judge rejected an antitrust challenge to the proposed takeover of subsidiary Sprint Corp (S.N) by T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O). FILE PHOTO: People walk behind the logo of SoftBank Corp in Tokyo December 18, 2014.  REUTERS/Toru HanaiThe ruling brings the Japanese technology conglomerate a significant step closer to slashing its exposure to a troubled asset at a time when other major bets face investor scepticism, and as it struggles to find backing for a successor to its $100 billion Vision Fund. “This is obviously great news for Sprint... It is better news for SoftBank,” analyst Kirk Boodry at Redex Holdings wrote in a note on the Smartkarma platform. A deal would remove the risk of SoftBank having to inject further funds into Sprint, though T-Mobile may push for better terms given Sprint’s relative weakness, Boodry wrote. Sprint is one of SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son’s biggest overseas investments with Japanese ownership reaching 84%, but the U.S. wireless carrier has struggled to compete with larger rivals, weighing down the group. It has long been linked with a merger with rival T-Mobile - leaving SoftBank with a minority stake - and on Tuesday, a federal judge rejected a claim by a group of states that such a tie-up would violate antitrust laws or raise prices. The ruling sent Sprint shares soaring 78%, while those of T-Mobile climbed 12%. SoftBank saw its shares open 12.5% higher in Tokyo on Wednesday, ending morning trade up 13.7% at 5,843 yen. The Japanese firm reports its earnings later on Wednesday, with Son speaking at an earnings briefing from 0700 GMT. Analysts on average expect SoftBank to report a 20% on-year fall in operating profit for the October-December quarter, weighed down by the performance of some of its Vision Fund’s tech bets. SHAREHOLDER VALUE The ruling is the latest news to boost SoftBank stock, which has risen 20% year-to-date, after sources last week told Reuters that activist hedge fund Elliott Management has amassed a stake of almost $3 billion in SoftBank and is pushing for change at the firm including $20 billion in stock buybacks. Under pressure to boost shareholder value, SoftBank is likely to launch a share buyback this month, Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal wrote in a note. The purchases should be funded by a partial sale of SoftBank’s 26% stake in Chinese e-commerce major Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), Goyal said.  Son previously dipped into the stake - which is currently worth $150 billion - selling Alibaba shares ahead of the 2016 acquisition of British chip designer Arm. SoftBank won big with Alibaba but has fared less well with its massive bets on U.S. office-sharing company WeWork and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N), and is struggling to raise outside capital for a second Vision Fund. WeWork Chairman Marcelo Claure has pulled forward the start-up’s target of becoming free cash flow positive by a year to 2022 in a boost to SoftBank’s bid to win back investor trust.

    "Title": "JD Sports may have to sell Footasylum if it doesn't address competition concerns: watchdog",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - UK sportswear retailer JD Sports (JD.L) may have to sell Footasylum if it does not address competition concerns about last year’s acquisition of its smaller rival, Britain’s competition watchdog said on Tuesday after an in-depth review of the takeover. FILE PHOTO: People pass a JD Sports store in London, Britain April 11, 2017.  REUTERS/Neil Hall/File PhotoJD Sports acquired Footasylum in an 86 million pound ($111 million) takeover completed last April but has faced scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) which has said the takeover could be bad for shoppers. On Tuesday, the CMA said it was concerned that the loss of high street competition could mean fewer discounts, clearance sales and promotions, a lower quality of customer service and less choice in stores and online. “(The CMA’s) current view is that blocking the deal by requiring JD Sports to sell the Footasylum business may be the only way of addressing these competition concerns,” Kip Meek, chair of a CMA panel that conducted the in-depth review said in a statement. JD, which has valued Footasylum at up to 90 million pounds ($116 million), said it would continue to make its case to the CMA ahead of a Feb. 25 deadline for new proposals from the company to remedy the concerns. “This (Footasylum) is a very small part of the JD machine but the explanation from the CMA is puzzling. It suggests JD would reduce range/service quality, odd when improving such factors has been its secret sauce,” Peel Hunt analysts said. JD has outperformed Britain’s struggling retail sector, helped by a strong online operation and the continuing popularity of its often discounted athleisure wear and trainers. On Tuesday it said that earnings for the financial year ending Feb. 1, 2020 were expected to be at least equal to the top end of market expectations of between 403 million pounds and 434 million pounds. That sent its shares, which have almost tripled in value since late 2018, up 3% in morning trade. The company also said that it still believed its acquisition of Footasylum would benefit both consumers and the UK high street. “Just take a walk down any major UK high street or search for Nike or Adidas trainers on Google and you can see for yourself how competitive this marketplace really is,” JD Chairman Peter Cowgill said in the statement. “We anticipate that Footasylum will contribute less than 2% of the Group’s earnings in the year to January 2020,” JD said. The CMA launched an in-depth review of the takeover last October after an initial review raised potential competition concerns. It said JD had failed to address its initial concerns.  The CMA’s investigation provisionally found that the two retailers compete closely and that surveyed customers indicated that there are only a small number of other chains they would consider buying from. The CMA said it would ask for views on its provisional findings by March 3 and will assess all evidence before making a final decision. It said it has extended the deadline for its final report to May 11, from March 16.

    "Title": "Geely to deepen ties with Volvo, plans to list under one umbrella",
    "Content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Geely Automobile (0175.HK) and its sister company Volvo Cars are planning to merge and list in Hong Kong and possibly Stockholm, giving Volvo access to public markets after it dropped a move to list its stock two years ago. Monday’s move to merge the two units come as global automakers pursue alliances to respond better to the cost of switching to electric cars, tougher emission rules and autonomous driving. Shares in Geely jumped as much as 11.5% to HK$15.28 on Tuesday. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL], Geely Automobile’s parent, bought Volvo Cars from Ford Motor Co (F.N) in 2010. Together with electric premium brand Polestar and Geely’s new energy brand Geometry, the new company will have five brands, with products ranging from affordable sedans to luxury sports cars, marking the emergence of China’s first global carmaker, analysts said. “Strategically, the deal feels like – after years of deal-making – a first move by Chairman Li Shufu to consolidate his sprawling automotive empire, and to pay off some of the debt that had built up,” analysts at Bernstein said in a note. It remains unclear how much valuation would be added to Geely, a Hong Kong-listed, $16 billion company, by injecting Volvo assets. Geely’s sales started to surge from 2015 as its products began incorporating Volvo technology. Geely Automobile sold 1.36 million cars in 2019 and aims to sell 1.4 million cars this year. Volvo sold just over 700,000 cars last year.  Volvo and its parent group had been discussing an IPO to value the carmaker at between $16 billion and $30 billion before they dropped the listing plan in 2018, sources said.  Compared to Volvo’s IPO plan, this proposal could better align Geely and Volvo’s interests, Shi Ji, an analyst at Haitong International wrote in a note. Such a merger would help Volvo cross sell Geely cars worldwide as well as those made by sister brand Lynk \u0026 Co. CAR COMBINATIONS Volvo Cars and Geely will create a joint working group to prepare a proposal for their respective boards, the companies said in a statement on Monday. Slideshow (3 Images)The parent group, led by billionaire Li, has a number of other investments including a 9.7% stake in Daimler (DAIGn.DE) acquired in 2018, a 49.9% stake in Malaysia’s Proton bought in 2017, and a majority stake in British sport car brand Lotus. In October, Volvo Cars said it would merge its engine development and manufacturing assets with those of Geely, creating a division to supply Lotus, LEVC, Lynk and Proton, and also potential rivals with next-generation combustion and hybrid engines. Among other car companies that are collaborating are Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Ford, which said last year they would  spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles, while FCA (FCHA.MI) and PSA (PEUP.PA) agreed a $50 billion merger to create the world’s fourth-biggest automaker.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: The logo of German lighting manufacturer Osram is illuminated at the company's headquarters in Munich, Germany, September 16, 2019. REUTERS/Andreas Gebert/File PhotoVIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian sensor specialist AMS (AMS.S) (AMS.VI) made clear on Monday that it aims to secure a so-called domination agreement with Osram (OSRn.DE) to allow it to use the lighting group’s cash flow to pay back debt. AMS, best known for supplying Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones with facial recognition technology, wants to form a global player in sensors and lights with its takeover of the leading manufacturer of car headlamps.  Having secured nearly 60% of Osram’s shares in December, taking on debt of 4.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion) to finance the deal, AMS gained shareholder approval for a 1.7 billion euro capital increase to help to fund the acquisition of the much bigger German group.     A domination and profit and loss transfer agreement (DPLTA) would give AMS full say over Osram’s finances and allow it to consolidate the company’s cash flow.  To clinch the agreement AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke needs approval from 75% of Osram investors at an extraordinary shareholder meeting. “We intend to implement a DPLTA to enable both companies to work together and realize our joint strategic vision of creating a global leader in sensor solutions and photonics in an efficient manner,” AMS Chief Executive Alexander Everke said in a statement on Monday. Until now AMS has told investors there might be a way to pay back debt and achieve targeted integration benefits of 300 million euros ($327 million), though analysts have been skeptical. The Austrian company would have to offer the remaining minority investors two alternatives: either pay them an annual guaranteed dividend or a cash settlement.

    "Title": "Xerox sweetens offer for HP",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Xerox Holdings Corp raised its offer to buy HP Inc by $2 to $24 per share on Monday, following several rejections of its previous buyout offer by the PC maker. The company logo for Xerox is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 11, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidXerox said its latest offer comprises $18.40 in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares for each HP share — valuing the company at about $35 billion — and that it plans to launch a tender offer on or around March 2.     HP shares rose nearly 3% to $22.31, while Xerox was up about 1%. The U.S. printer maker first made a $33.5 billion cash-and-stock offer for HP, a company more than three times its size, in November. HP’s board had then rejected the offer, saying it significantly undervalued the company. “This bid increase puts more pressure on Xerox to extract costs as a combined entity. I’d look for HP to question the economics of the synergies after Xerox raising their bid,” Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said.  Xerox said last month it planned to nominate 11 independent candidates to HP’s board and that it had secured $24 billion in financing for the offer. The company also expects its proposed acquisition to result in sales growth of as much as $1.5 billion for the combined company, according to a presentation by Xerox in December. Some Wall Street analysts have said a merger would help the companies in a declining printing market, while others have cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models. “While we believe the printing market is ripe for consolidation, we question why Xerox would want to acquire one of the largest players in a slowing computer market,” Cash said.  In December, activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 4.2% stake in HP and a 10.9% stake in Xerox, urged HP shareholders who had agreed to the merger to reach out to the PC maker’s directors for immediate action. HP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal could be worth around $9 billion in cash and drove shares in Exor up by more than 5% on Monday to an all-time high.   Exor, led by Agnelli scion John Elkann, bought the Bermuda-based reinsurer in 2016 for $6.9 billion after a hostile takeover battle with Axis Capital. (AXS.N) Analysts at Mediobanca calculated PartnerRe represents about 28% of Exor’s total assets.  The source, who declined to be named, said Exor would use the cash from any ParnerRe sale mainly for acquisitions. The cash would be in addition to the 3.6 billion euros ($3.9 billion) Elkann said last November the group would have by 2022 to spend on acquisitions.  That sum includes a planned special dividend of around 1.6 billion euros from the merger between Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and French rival Peugeot (PEUP.PA). An analyst at Intesa Sanpaolo said on Monday the ParnerRe deal could also pave the way for a potential extraordinary pay-out to Exor shareholders, but the source said Exor planned to focus on acquisitions. Money from a completed PartnerRe deal would only be received around the end of this year, the source said, adding the group would consider carefully before spending it. “Exor is not a fund that needs to give a yield to subscribers every year. It wants to take time to pick the best investment options,” the source said. “It wants to avoid being offered over-priced assets simply because people know they’re sitting on loads of cash”. In November, Elkann said Exor had not yet decided which sectors might interest the company, but said he saw the group “buying new companies in the future”.     Besides FCA, Exor’s assets include controlling stakes in luxury carmaker Ferrari (RACE.MI), industrial vehicle manufacturer CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI) and Italian Serie A soccer team Juventus (JUVE.MI). It also has a 43% stake in publishing group The Economist. Reporting by Giulio Piovaccari; editing by Barbara LewisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Airbus likely to acquire Bombardier's remaining stake in A220 passenger jet: sources",
    "Content": "MONTREAL/PARIS (Reuters) - Europe’s Airbus SE (AIR.PA) is likely to acquire Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier Inc’s (BBDb.TO) remaining stake in the A220 passenger jet program, two industry sources said. FILE PHOTO: The Airbus logo is pictured at Airbus headquarters in Blagnac near Toulouse, France, March 20, 2019.  REUTERS/Regis DuvignauA deal for Airbus to buy the 33.58% share in the program was widely expected after Bombardier said in January it was reviewing the stake in the joint venture. Barring surprises, a deal is expected next week ahead of both companies’ earnings reports on Feb. 13, the sources added. Airbus and Bombardier both declined to comment. The terms of a potential deal that would mark Bombardier’s exit from commercial aviation were unclear.  Bombardier, which is weighing additional asset sales, faced a cash crunch in 2015 due to its high-stakes bet on the technologically advanced narrowbody. Bombardier shares closed up 2.8%. Montreal-based Bombardier ceded control of the program to Airbus in 2018 for a token C$1 as part of broader efforts to improve its finances. It retained a minority stake alongside the Canadian province of Quebec. Bombardier had warned the program would require additional cash to ramp up production, and could be subject to a writedown, as it faces higher-than-expected costs in its rail division and more than $9 billion of debt. Since Airbus took over the program, the A220 has seen a sharp pickup in sales to 658 orders as of Jan. 31. But it has not seen the cost declines expected from Airbus applying its greater purchasing power with suppliers, one of the sources said. A deal would leave Airbus to shoulder additional investments required by the plane program. “Airbus did not particularly want to do this at this time, but is presented with little choice if Bombardier is pulling back,” the second source said.  Airbus, with a 50.6% stake in the program, delivered 48 A220 jets in 2019 and is ramping up production toward its maximum monthly capacity of 10 jets in Mirabel, Quebec, and four planes at a second line in Alabama by mid-decade. Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer told Reuters in January the company was progressing toward its target of a double-digit percentage reduction in the A220’s production costs. Quebec, with a 16.36% stake in the A220 program, would not invest further. Rather, it is trying to protect the program’s estimated 2,700 jobs, along with the province’s $1 billion investment in the program, Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said on Monday. “We put $1 billion in it and that’s enough.”  Reporting by Allison Lampert and Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Diane Craft, David Gregorio and Richard ChangOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "'No concrete proposition' from U.S. to back Huawei rival Ericsson: Swedish minister",
    "Content": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s digital minister stressed Ericsson’s (ERICb.ST) importance for jobs and technology in Europe on Friday after a U.S. official suggested the United States buy stakes in the telecoms gear maker or Finland’s Nokia (NOKIA.HE) to counter Huawei’s dominance in 5G. FILE PHOTO: The Ericsson logo is seen at the Ericsson's headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden June 14, 2018. Picture taken June 14, 2018. REUTERS/Olof Swahnberg/File PhotoU.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a speech on Thursday that the United States and its allies should consider the highly unusual step of taking a “controlling stake” in one or both of the Nordic rivals to China-based Huawei. 5G networks are at the center of a dispute over technology between the United States and China as they are expected to host a range of critical functions from driverless vehicles to smart electric grids and military communications, underscoring their importance to national security. The United States has blacklisted Huawei and is in the midst of a worldwide campaign to convince allies to ban the Chinese giant from their 5G networks, alleging its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying - which Huawei denies. Barr’s comments helped lift shares in the Nordic companies, with Ericsson gaining 4% and Nokia 6% by 1344 GMT. Sweden’s Minister for Energy and Digital Development Anders Ygeman said potential U.S. interest in Ericsson made sense, given that no U.S. company offers a full suite of 5G products, but he stressed the company’s importance for Swedish business. “At the same time there is no concrete proposition from America and if there were such a proposal it would be up to Ericsson shareholders to respond to that,” he told Reuters. “Clearly there is both a strong Swedish and European interest in being able to continue to lead technological development. Ericsson is important both for jobs and business in Sweden but also as a technology leader.”    U.S. government investments in public companies are rare except in bailouts to save ailing firms and jobs, and even more so concerning foreign companies. The two firms have a combined market capitalization of about $50 billion and it is unclear how the U.S. government would fund investment in the companies or indeed how European regulators and governments would view such a move. Related CoverageSweden says U.S. interest in Ericsson logical for 5G capabilityHIGHEST PRIORITY While the two companies, which together with Huawei dominate the market, declined to comment on Barr’s remarks, Ericsson shareholder, activist fund Cevian Capital, said it welcomed the apparent U.S. interest and urged executives at the Swedish company in which it holds an 8.4% stake to explore the potential opportunity. “A U.S. interest in Ericsson is clearly positive for Sweden, the company and the shareholders,” Cevian Capital managing partner Christer Gardell told Reuters in emailed comments.  “A potential deal would have to be based on a completely different valuation level than today’s ridiculous share price for Ericsson,” Gardell added. “The board and management need to drive and handle this question with the highest priority.”   At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, U.S. President Donald Trump had a dinner with executives from 25 multinational companies and organizations bit.ly/2UEUtmi, including the CEOs of Ericsson and Nokia, with talks touching on issues such as the 5G networks rollouts in the United States.  The head of Sweden’s shareholders’ association, Aktiespararna, said there were likely to be simpler and cheaper ways for the United States to tap into Ericsson’s expertise and questioned the wisdom of making clear its interest. “If the interest in Ericsson is serious it is not the best strategy to spread rumors about it and in that way raise the price of the share, making the company more expensive,” Aktiespararna CEO Joacim Olsson said.     Investment firm Investor AB (INVEb.ST), the biggest owner by voting rights in Ericsson, declined to comment, as did the second-biggest owner by votes, Industrivarden (INDUa.ST). Barr said in his speech at a conference on Chinese economic espionage that a move to secure a controlling interest in Huawei’s main rivals could take place “either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies”. Over the past decade, speculation has circulated among investors and media concerning potential interest from U.S. technology giant Cisco’s (CSCO.O) in a tie-up with Ericsson, although a concrete offer has never materialized. FILE PHOTO: Visitors gather outside the Nokia booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2019. REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File PhotoPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order last year barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk and he has pressed nations not to grant Huawei access to 5G networks. Britain in late January still granted Huawei a limited role in the country’s 5G mobile network, and the EU followed its example by allowing members to decide what part Huawei can play in its 5G networks.

    "Title": "Hedge fund Elliott Management builds $3 billion stake in SoftBank: sources",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, one of the world’s most powerful activist investors, has amassed a nearly $3 billion stake in SoftBank Group Corp and is pushing for changes to boost the Japanese conglomerate’s value, sources said.  FILE PHOTO - The logo of SoftBank Group Corp is displayed at SoftBank World 2017 conference in Tokyo, Japan, July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Issei KatoElliott’s involvement is likely to cast new light on SoftBank’s financial track record, which has been scrutinized heavily by investors after several of its expensive bets on startups around the world, including office space-sharing firm WeWork, soured. The New York-headquartered hedge fund has owned SoftBank shares for years but late last year grew its stake into one of its largest-ever positions in a company, the sources said. Elliott now owns roughly 3% of SoftBank, the sources added. SoftBank has been vulnerable to investor criticism that its stock trades at a deep discount to the value of its holdings. Its shares jumped 8% on Friday morning in Tokyo, giving the conglomerate a market capitalization of roughly $95 billion. The value of its stakes in Alibaba, Sprint and its Japanese telecom business is roughly $210 billion. Elliott, which oversees $40 billion in assets, has held discussions with SoftBank’s management and is calling on the company to buy back some $20 billion of its stock, improve its governance by increasing the independence and diversity of its board and improving transparency, the sources said. “Elliott’s substantial investment in SoftBank Group reflects its strong conviction that the market significantly undervalues SoftBank’s portfolio of assets,” an Elliott spokeswoman said. “Elliott has engaged privately with SoftBank’s leadership and is working constructively on solutions to help SoftBank materially and sustainably reduce its discount to intrinsic value,” the Elliott spokeswoman added. SoftBank said it welcomes investors’ feedback. “We are in complete agreement that our shares are deeply undervalued by public investors,” a SoftBank spokeswoman said.  The Wall Street Journal first reported Elliott’s stake on Thursday. Elliott believes SoftBank could raise money for share buybacks by selling a small share of its publicly listed holdings and make its purchases at a sharp discount, the sources said. The hedge fund is also calling for changes in how decisions are made at SoftBank, where its founder, Masayoshi Son, owns 25%. Major corporate decisions at the company require support from two-thirds of its shareholders, but Elliott has no plans to challenge Son’s position. Some of the discussions with Elliott have centered around improving the way investment decisions are made at SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund. Its mixed track record has weighed on SoftBank’s effort to raise a second fund of similar size.  Japan has become a fertile hunting ground for activist investors in recent months with Daniel Loeb’s Third Point calling on Sony to spin off its semiconductor unit and Olympus Corp inviting ValueAct Capital to become a director on its board early last year. FILE PHOTO: Japan's SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son bows his head after his presentation at a news conference in Tokyo, Japan, November 5, 2018.  REUTERS/Kim Kyung-HoonOffice-sharing company WeWork was last year’s most high-profile IPO casualty, revising down its potential IPO valuation by tens of billions of dollars before eventually shelving plans to go public. It was bailed out by SoftBank for close to $10 billion.  WeWork was not the first setback for the stock market debuts of SoftBank investments. Shares in ride-hailing app Uber Technologies have fallen by more than a third since its listing. Shares of Slack Technologies, which develops productivity software, have tumbled by almost half.

    "Title": "Intercontinental Exchange abandons deal talks with eBay",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - New York Stock Exchange owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE) (ICE.N) said it had decided to stop exploring deal options with eBay Inc (EBAY.O), just hours after its chief executive said he would “love” to speak with the e-commerce company. FILE PHOTO: A screen displays the ticker symbol and logo for Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) March 1, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidICE’s shares, which fell as much as 6.5% during regular trading on Thursday, were up nearly 3% after the bell, following the news, while eBay’s stock fell nearly 7%. ICE confirmed on Tuesday it had approached eBay to explore “a range of potential opportunities,” following reports it had mulled a more than $30 billion takeover of the online marketplace, but that eBay was unresponsive. “I didn’t think it’s particularly shocking and outrageous,” Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Sprecher told analysts on a post-earnings call. Analysts had questioned how ICE, which also runs futures exchanges and clearinghouses, and provides financial data, would absorb the e-commerce company. Sprecher said he first reached out to eBay around 20 years ago when ICE was launching as a place to match buyers and sellers of electric power, and that then-CEO Meg Whitman advised him on building an online marketplace. He said eBay was one of dozens of companies ICE has continued to share ideas with. In recent years, ICE has made acquisitions that have helped it expand beyond its traditional transactional revenue model, to more stable subscription-based revenues, leveraging data and expanding into areas such as electronic mortgage registrations, rewards points, and a market for purchases in video games. “We know the lane that creates value for us,” Sprecher said. “And so when we think about, is there a marketplace for airline miles or swords and sickles that are on a video game, we’re not crazy. We didn’t lose our minds. We know what our platform does and we know how to lever it.” The Atlanta-based company said its fourth-quarter profit fell 27%, mainly due to lower revenue from its transaction and clearing business, as market volatility declined.  Quarterly net income fell to $448 million, or 80 cents per share, from $611 million, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Discarding one-time items, like merger and acquisition costs, ICE earned 95 cents per share, meeting analysts’ estimates.

    "Title": "Fiat Chrysler profit rises, outlook 'firm' ahead of Peugeot merger",
    "Content": "MILAN/DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) posted a 7% rise in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, boosted by strong business in North America and better results in Latin America as it headed into a merger with France’s PSA (PEUP.PA).  FILE PHOTO: A new Fiat 500 mild-hybrid car is displayed at a Fiat Chrysler event held to unveil its first hybrid models, in Bologna, Italy, February 4, 2020. REUTERS/Flavio Lo Scalzo/File PhotoIn a briefing with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Michael Manley said FCA was still “firm” on its financial guidance for 2020. Still, he warned that disruptions due to the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China could threaten production at one of Fiat Chrysler’s European plants within two to four weeks. He did not identify which plant could be affected. FCA so far has not reported production shutdowns at plants outside China related to the outbreak. Chinese auto parts and assembly plants have extended previously planned Lunar New Year’s shutdowns through Feb. 9, and some have pushed the shutdowns out further. FCA operates in China through a loss-making joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC) (601238.SS) and has a 0.35% share of the Chinese passenger car market. Manley said FCA plans to meet tighter emissions regulations in Europe initially with new hybrid gasoline-electric versions of several Jeep models, with plans to shift eventually to more pure electric models beyond 2025. He said the automaker expected to meet future emissions standards without buying credits from electric carmaker Tesla after 2021 in Europe and after 2023 in the United States as it introduces more hybrid models that produce lower emissions. “Beyond 2025, full electric (vehicles) will become the norm” across the industry, Manley said, ultimately replacing hybrids which are facing future bans in several countries.  Asked about FCA’s short-term reliance on hybrids rather than pure electric vehicles to meet lower CO2 levels, he said, “We are going to be part of that solution” with future electric vehicles, but “in the most cost-effective way we possibly can.” The Italian-American carmaker said adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose to 2.12 billion euros ($2.3 billion), in line with a 2.11 billion forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. That left its adjusted operating profit for the year at 6.67 billion euros, just shy of its target of over 6.7 billion euros. Its adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 6.2%, in line with its target of more than 6.1%. A trader said Fiat Chrysler (FCA) results were “a touch above” expectations, and the carmaker’s shares in New York were up 1.3% in early trading, while shares in Milan were up 1.9%. Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and Peugeot maker PSA agreed in December to combine forces in a $50 billion deal to create the world’s No. 4 carmaker, in response to slower global demand and the mounting cost of making cleaner cars amid tighter emissions rules. Manley said last month that talks with PSA were progressing and he hoped to complete the deal by early 2021. FCA reiterated its plan to boost adjusted EBIT to more than 7 billion euros this year.

French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, Italian Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli and Poland’s Development Minister Jadwiga Emilewicz in a joint letter to EU competition and digital chief Margrethe Vestager called for proposals by the end of June. Le Maire and Altmaier kicked off the debate more than a year ago after Vestager vetoed Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and Alstom’s (ALSO.PA) bid to merge their rail operations to face off Chinese competitors. To mollify such concerns, Vestager has subsequently said she was looking to update various elements of EU competition rules to meet digital and green challenges and also reviewing guidelines on state aid and agreements between companies. She will also issue rules in the coming months which will rein in U.S. tech giants’ market power. Vestager’s spokeswoman said the letter from the four ministers would be taken into account in the debate. “Europe’s future industrial, ecological and digital strategy must be based on fair competition,” spokeswoman Arianna Podesta said. “Sound EU competition rules can enable pro-competitive cooperation, including data sharing and data pooling, support the growth and development of strong European companies, whether larger ones or SMEs, and further enable and support the greening of our economy.” EU antitrust enforcers should take into account state aid provided to foreign companies, use interim measures to tackle online platforms’ dominance, reinforce advisory committees made up of national competition watchdogs and set up an independent scientific expert body to assist them, they said.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Prudential eyes full control of China venture, considers U.S. options",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Prudential (PRU.L) is in talks that could lead to it taking full control of its 50:50 joint venture with China’s CITIC (0267.HK) and is considering selling some or all of its U.S. business to sharpen its focus on Asia, a source told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: The logo of British life insurer Prudential is seen on their building in London, Britain March 17, 2019. REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File PhotoChanges in January to foreign ownership laws in China have made it possible for the first time for the British life insurer to own all of its CITIC joint venture, a landmark transaction which the source said Prudential was working towards. Prudential has not made a formal application to increase its ownership yet but is checking the plan would win approval from the Chinese authorities before it submits an application, the source said. Insiders at the $48 billion company say the deal could offer a boost to China as it battles to minimize the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak that has disrupted travel to the country and put several cities on lockdown. It would be hard to put a timescale on the approval process for a possible transaction, the source said, adding that the Chinese authorities were capable of acting fast to grant the necessary permissions if CITIC was willing to sell. “They want foreign investment post-virus,” the source said.  Analysts at KBW said they expected Prudential to spend “a few billion” dollars increasing their stake in the venture. The company no longer has any British or European business after splitting off its M\u0026G (MNG.L) insurance and asset management unit last year. The growth of the middle class in Asian economies and the lack of state retirement benefits have driven demand for private life and health insurance.  Many western insurers have joint ventures in China but the Prudential-CITIC venture is among the largest, with around 20 provincial licenses. Chinese officials have become more welcoming of British and European companies amid Beijing’s trade tussle with the United States, the source added. Insurance sales for Prudential’s Chinese business rose 45% in the first half of 2019, and the recent coronavirus outbreak is not seen having much direct impact, analysts said. Its shares have fallen by 1.5% so far this year but the insurer has low exposure to Wuhan, where the virus originated.  Prudential, which sells insurance in China through 55,000 agents, is opening a technical center in Shenzhen, in mainland China, where hiring is cheaper than Hong Kong because the cost of living is lower. JACKSON FOR SALE In addition to the China plans, Prudential is looking at ways to reduce its ownership of its U.S. business Jackson. Analysts say there is little logic in Prudential holding onto the business, which has few synergies with its Asian arm. All options are on the table as Jackson seeks “outside capital”, the source said, adding that the business was attracting interest from private equity firms, sovereign wealth funds and Canadian pension funds. Jackson had an operating profit of 1.9 billion pounds in 2018 compared with 2.2 billion for Prudential’s Asian business. New business sales for the United States totaled only 1.5 billion pounds compared with 3.7 billion in Asia. A dilution of ownership in Jackson would leave the 170-year-old insurer, Britain’s biggest, with the vast bulk of its operations in Asia, along with a smaller African business.

    "Title": "UniCredit cuts further its stake in Turkey's Yapi Kredi",
    "Content": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s biggest bank by assets UniCredit (CRDI.MI) took a further step on Wednesday in a strategy to streamline its structure, announcing the placement of a 12% stake in Turkish bank Yapi Kredi (YKBNK.IS).  FILE PHOTO: Yapi Kredi Bank headquarters is pictured in Istanbul, Turkey February 3, 2016. REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File PhotoUniCredit, which reports full-year earnings on Thursday, has been shedding assets and mending its balance sheet under Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier, who arrived in 2016 to turn the bank around amid concerns over its capital base.  The latest move in the French banker’s strategy, which has led UniCredit out of Poland and shrunk its domestic footprint, was the decision in November to dissolve a joint venture with Turkish conglomerate Koc Holding. The unwinding of the JV handed UniCredit a direct 31.9% stake in Yapi which would fall to 20% after the share placement. Through the JV, UniCredit had indirectly held 40% of Yapi, the country’s third-largest bank. An economic recession in Turkey and the free fall of the lira currency forced UniCredit to write down the asset by 846 million euros back in 2018. UniCredit said the sale had yielded around 440 million euros. It added the transaction would generate a negative 0.82 billion euro impact on first quarter earnings partly due to the difference between the market value of the stake and its book value. “The transaction is part of UniCredit’s on-going strategy to simplify its shareholdings and to optimize its capital allocation,” the bank said in a statement. UniCredit said in December it planned to book a 400 million euro ($440 million) charge in the fourth quarter of 2019 in relation to the unwinding of the accord with Koc. This and other one-off hits, coupled with large writedowns of problem loans the bank has decided to bring forward, are behind the 1.1 billion euro net loss forecast by analysts for the quarter in a consensus provided by the company.  Morgan Stanley, Citi, JPMorgan, and UniCredit/Kepler Cheuvreux are managing the accelerated book-building process. The sale was completed at a price of 2.88 Turkish liras for each Yapi share, equivalent to a 4% discount to Wednesday’s closing price of 3.00 liras.

    "Title": "Intercontinental Exchange says it explored deal with eBay",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, said on Tuesday it had approached e-commerce company eBay Inc to explore “a range of potential opportunities”. The German headquarters of online marketplace eBay is pictured at Europarc Dreilinden business park south of Berlin in Kleinmachnow, Germany, August 6, 2019. REUTERS/Fabrizio BenschThe statement came after people familiar with the matter said ICE discussed a potential takeover of eBay. The acquisition would exceed $30 billion and represent a substantial departure from ICE’s focus on financial markets.  The move would call on ICE’s technological expertise in running markets to extract efficiencies from eBay’s marketplace platform, which connects buyers and sellers of goods around the world. ICE said in its statement that “eBay has not engaged in a meaningful way”, and as a result, it was not in negotiations regarding the sale of all or part of eBay.  The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the deal discussions, said ICE is not interested in eBay’s classified ad unit, which eBay has been considering selling. EBay declined to comment. EBay’s board issued a statement on Wednesday morning saying it is “aligned and open to all value-enhancing alternatives.”  EBay’s shares ended trading 8.7% firmer at $37.41 on Tuesday following the news, giving it a market value of $30.4 billion. ICE shares fell 7.5% to $92.59, giving the company a market value of $51.6 billion, as investors fretted a deal could be dilutive for the stock exchange operator. ICE, which also operates futures exchanges and clearing-houses, has faced pressure from U.S. regulators to freeze or reduce the fees it charges to operate financial markets, spurring it to diversify its business.  ICE’s approach rekindles debate among investors over whether eBay should be moving faster to shed its classifieds business, which advertises products and services for sale off the eBay marketplace.  Earlier on Tuesday, activist shareholder Starboard Value LP once again called on eBay Inc to sell off its classifieds business, arguing the company has not made enough progress to improve shareholder value. “To achieve the optimal outcome, we believe Classifieds must be separated, and a more comprehensive and aggressive operating plan must be put in place to drive profitable growth in the core Marketplace business,” Starboard said in a letter to eBay’s board. The San Jose, California-based e-commerce firm said it would “review Starboard’s letter and perspectives.” EBay has been shifting focus to its advertising and payments businesses amid stiff competition in its marketplace business from Amazon.com Inc and Walmart Inc. The company faced pressure last year not only from Starboard but also from hedge fund Elliott Management. In a settlement, eBay offered a board seat to Elliott’s Jesse Cohn and to Matt Murphy, president and CEO of Marvell Technology, which was backed by Starboard. EBay also agreed in March to conduct a strategic review of its business, and in November agreed to sell StubHub for $4.05 billion in cash. The company is expected to provide an update this year on its classifieds business, which Elliott valued at between $8 billion and $12 billion.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: A model of a wind turbine with the Siemens Gamesa logo is displayed outside the annual general shareholders meeting in Zamudio, Spain, June 20, 2017. REUTERS/Vincent West/File PhotoMUNICH (Reuters) - Siemens (SIEGn.DE) is buying Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) stake in Siemens Gamesa renewable energy (SGREN.MC), the German engineering company said, as it prepares to merge the business with its own energy unit ahead of a floatation later this year. Siemens on Tuesday approved the purchase of the Spanish utility’s 8.1% stake in SGRE, at a price of 20 euros ($22.08) per share. Siemens will pay 1.1 billion euros and will transfer the shares to its future Siemens Energy unit, combining it with its gas and power business, the Munich company said. “Siemens Gamesa is a vital cornerstone in the new Siemens Energy portfolio in order to shape the necessary energy transition from conventional to renewable energy,” said Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser. Siemens has recently come under fire from environmentalists after it agreed to honor a contract to supply signaling equipment to a massive coal mine project in Australia. Kaeser said Siemens Gamesa has “considerable potential to grow and create significant value,” although the wind turbines business has struggled recently. On Tuesday, it reported a net loss of 174 million euros ($192.34 million) in the three months to December, down from an 18 million euro net profit in the same period a year earlier, blaming project delays caused by the early onset of wintry weather in northern Europe. Last week, the company formed in 2017 by a merger between Spain’s Gamesa and the wind business of Germany’s Siemens, cut its profitability target for the financial year 2020 for a second time in three months. Following the acquisition of the shares Siemens Energy will hold about 67% of the voting rights at Siemens Gamesa giving it a two-thirds majority at the company’s annual general meeting. No mandatory takeover offer to SGRE’s external shareholders is planned, Siemens said. Reporting by John Revill; Editing by Edward TaylorOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Ups and downs: the battle to buy Thyssenkrupp's elevator unit",
    "Content": "FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Finland’s Kone (KNEBV.HE) and private equity firms are battling to buy ThyssenKrupp’s (TKAG.DE) prized elevator division worth more than 15 billion euros ($16.6 billion), a deal which would be Europe’s biggest private equity deal in 13 years. A model of the elevator called MULTI is pictured inside Thyssenkrupp's elevator test tower in Rottweil, Germany, January 21, 2020. REUTERS/Michaela RehleThyssenkrupp says it will either list the business, sell either a stake or the business in its entirety as the company aims to cut 12.4 billion euros ($13.7 billion) in debt and pension liabilities. The deadline for binding bids for the whole business is mid-February.  SUITORS LINE UP Suitors are: * Kone has submitted a 17 billion euro non-binding bid, including a roughly 3-billion break fee, beating three private equity consortia whose offers were between 15-16 billion. Union sources say that may not be enough to compensate for antitrust risks. Analysts at Jefferies said that a price tag of 15.6 billion euros after tax would be enough “to negate net debt and pension liabilities, saving about 1.1 billion in outflows per year”. The rival private equity consortia are: * Blackstone (BX.N), Carlyle (CG.O) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board * A group comprising Advent, Cinven [CINV.UL], the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Germany’s RAG foundation * Canada’s Brookfield (BAMa.TO) and Singapore’s Temasek [TEM.UL] A buyout group victory would be Europe’s biggest private equity deal since KKR’s (KKR.N) $21.4 billion acquisition of Britain’s Alliance Boots Plc in 2007, according to Refinitiv data. KONE VS PRIVATE EQUITY While being the safest option in terms of execution, a flotation is seen as unlikely at this stage as it wouldn’t bring in enough cash. That’s why a sale to private equity looks like the easiest option as it would face little or no antitrust scrutiny and could be completed in months. A sale to Kone runs the risk of a lengthy regulatory review, even when taking into account a plan to sell Thyssenkrupp’s elevator assets in Europe, where overlap is biggest, to CVC [CVC.UL] to try to resolve antitrust risks. Danske Bank reckons that the combined market share of Thyssen and Kone stands at 43% in North America, which is also expected to lead to a deepened probe. It took Linde (LINI.DE) and Praxair nearly 17 months to get U.S. antitrust approval for a merger, and only following far-reaching remedy sales to CVC and Messer. Still reeling from Brussels’ veto of a planned steel tie-up with India’s Tata Steel (TISC.NS), Thyssenkrupp’s appetite for that is considered to be limited.        JOB SECURITY Bidders are courting representatives of IG Metall, Germany’s most powerful union which can make or break any deal and will fight to protect jobs and secure sites. The elevator business employs more than 53,000, a third of Thyssenkrupp’s total staff. Slideshow (2 Images)Labour representatives also control half of Thyssenkrupp’s 20-member supervisory board, which will have to approve an agreement. Workers fear that a sale to Kone carries a higher risk of job cuts than a sale to private equity. While cost savings are a key for all bidders, Kone needs synergies to justify its higher price tag. Labour leaders also remain sceptical about Kone’s plan to sell Thyssenkrupp’s European assets to CVC, as it is uncertain what would happen to workers at the 2.1 billion euro business.

    "Content": "(Reuters) - A California lawmaker has introduced a bill aimed at making PG\u0026E Corp (PCG.N) a publicly owned utility, a year after liabilities from wildfires traced back to some of its equipment pushed the power producer into bankruptcy. FILE PHOTO: PG\u0026E works on power lines to repair damage caused by the Camp Fire in Paradise, California, U.S. November 21, 2018.  To match Special Report USA-FUNDS/INDEX  REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo“Today I’m introducing legislation to force PG\u0026E to become a publicly owned utility,” California State Senator Scott Wiener said on Monday, adding it was time for a new approach at the utility company. \"PG\u0026E has failed. It's failed on safety \u0026 reliability. PG\u0026E has forfeited its privilege to operate as an investor-owned monopoly in California,\" he said in a tweet bit.ly/2v317Ik. The company said it opposed the bill from Wiener. “PG\u0026E’s facilities are not for sale,” a company spokesman told Reuters in an emailed statement.  “Changing the structure of the company would not create a safer or cleaner operation. Recent takeover attempts have largely failed due to a range of factors,” the spokesman said. The power producer said on Saturday it had submitted an updated reorganization plan including a new board of directors and new roles aimed at addressing concerns raised by California Governor Gavin Newsom. Newsom last month rejected an earlier PG\u0026E reorganization plan saying it lacked major changes in governance and tougher safety enforcement mechanisms mandated under a recent state wildfire statute. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in January last year, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment. Separately, it came under renewed criticism last year for precautionary power outages to guard against the risk of wildfires posed by extremely dry and windy weather.

    "Content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Payments company Worldline agreed on Monday to buy French rival  Ingenico (INGC.PA) in a 7.8 billion euro ($8.7 billion) deal,  creating a European leader in a sector trying to keep up with fast-changing consumer habits and technologies.  A logo of payments company Worldline is seen in the illustration picture taken February 3, 2020. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/IllustrationThe growing use of smartphones for online payments, including through Apple Pay (AAPL.O) or WeChat (0700.HK), is sparking competition in the industry to develop new, adapted processing systems, often requiring large investments.  The purchase by Worldline, which was born out of French IT company Atos (ATOS.PA), follows a wave of mergers and acquisitions last year among U.S. rivals also looking to try and build up their share of digital transactions.  Firms in the sector provide everything from the card terminals found in shops to broader services such as transaction security for retailers and banks, and many now want to be present across the whole payment chain.  “We’re likely to see more consolidation,” Worldline Chief executive Gilles Grapinet told reporters, adding that it was an industry with cost advantages for those operating on a large scale.  The takeover of Ingenico gives the firm an implied equity value of 7.8 billion euros and would immediately boost Worldline’s earnings per share, with around 250 million euros expected in savings by 2024. The price tag implies a premium of about 16% to Ingenico’s closing market value on Friday of around 6.7 billion euros. Asked about any potential anti-trust regulatory hurdles, Grapinet said the transaction was expected to close “rapidly”, in the third quarter of 2020.      The global payments industry is set to reach $3 trillion a year in revenue by 2023 as more people switch from cash to digital payments for online and store purchases, according to research by consulting firm McKinsey. In 2019, Fiserv Inc (FISV.O) bought First Data Corp for $22 billion, while Fidelity National Information Services (FIS) (FIS.N) bought Worldpay for about $35 billion, consolidating their positions as the top two players globally. INGENICO SHARES SURGE Shares in Ingenico - which was long seen as a target and  drew interest from Edenred (EDEN.PA) and French bank Natixis (CNAT.PA) last year - were up 12.7 by 1243 GMT, while those of smaller rivals like Italy’s Nexi (NEXII.MI) also rallied on Monday amid talk of more sector consolidation.  Worldline shares pared earlier losses but were still 2.6% lower, reflecting some concerns that it is paying a hefty premium to buy Ingenico. On closing the deal, former Worldline shareholders would own 65% of the combined entity and former Ingenico shareholders would own 35%. Worldline boss Grapinet would become CEO of the combined company and Ingenico Chairman Bernard Bourigeaud would become non-executive chairman. Ingenico shareholders would receive 11 Worldline shares and 160.5 euros in cash for seven Ingenico shares, in a primary tender offer. There would also be a secondary offer, with 56 Worldline shares exchanged for 29 Ingenico shares, translating into an offer price of 123.10 euros per Ingenico share. Worldline, in which Atos still has a 16.9% equity stake, said the deal would give it access to Ingenico’s strong presence in the travel, health and retail sectors, while the combined company would have also have an extended partnership with German savings banks. The Ingenico division housing its card terminal business, one area where it has struggled more in recent years, will undergo a strategic review, Worldline’s Grapinet said.  Creating a European champion able to compete with bigger American rivals could be welcomed by European politicians.  “The local tie up by Ingenico and Worldline makes sense so instead of competing with each other in their domestic space the combined company can focus on bigger fish to fry,” said MB Capital managing director Marcus Bullus. Atos welcomed the deal and said it could continue to sell down its stake in Worldline. BPI, a state-backed French bank with a 5% stake in Ingenico, will look to bulk up its holding in the combined entity so that it remains around that level, a source close to the deal said.  BPI was not immediately available to comment.  Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Cardinal Partners were the financial advisers to Worldline, while Goldman Sachs Paris (GS.N) and Rothschild (ROTH.PA) advised Ingenico.

    "Title": "Takeaway buys Just Eat for $7.8 billion, must wait to merge operations",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: Signage for Just Eat is seen on the window of a restaurant in London, Britain, August 5, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville./File PhotoAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch online food ordering company Takeaway.com on Friday declared its $7.8 billion takeover of British peer Just Eat unconditional, though the two companies still need a competition authority’s approval before merging operations.  Takeaway said in a statement that shares in the combination will begin trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, Feb. 3. But the company said an investigation by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is still ongoing and the two companies must continue operating under separate management and branding until that is complete. Takeaway said it expects that to happen on March 5.   The CMA competition investigation centers on whether Takeaway might have re-entered the UK market - which it quit in 2016 - if its takeover of Just Eat had not succeeded. Takeaway says that is not the case. Just Eat said in a separate statement it is sure the merger will not result in a “significant lessening” of competition in the UK food delivery market, adding that it would fully abide by the CMA’s order and work with it through the investigation.  On Jan. 10, Takeaway claimed victory in its all-stock bid for Just Eat, beating out a rival cash bid from tech investment giant Prosus NV(PRX.AS) after a lengthy battle. It said on Friday that 92.2% of shareholders have now tendered shares to its offer. Takeaway intends to launch a squeeze out process to acquire the rest. Just Eat on Tuesday forecast 2019 core earnings of about 200 million pounds  ($262.88 million) and said it agreed to partner with McDonald’s in Britain and Ireland, becoming the fast-food chain’s second delivery provider after Uber Eats.

    "Title": "Aston Martin's lifeline buys carmaker time as SUV hits road",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll and investors have rescued Aston Martin with a 500 million pound cash injection that analysts say will help stabilize the British carmaker whose first sport utility vehicle (SUV) is set to hit the road. FILE PHOTO: An Aston Martin logo is pictured at the new factory in Saint Athan, Wales, Britain December 6, 2019.   REUTERS/Rebecca Naden/File PhotoStroll agreed to buy up to 20% of the 107-year-old company and will become executive chairman of James Bond’s automaker of choice, which has gone bankrupt seven times in its chequered history. A consortium led by Stroll will invest 182 million pounds ($239 million), whilst major existing shareholders - primarily Italian and Kuwaiti private equity groups - will be part of a rights issue to raise 318 million pounds.  “It likely gives them enough liquidity to tide them over for a couple of years,” said Charles Coldicott, Redburn equity research analyst. Outgoing chairwoman Penny Hughes, who will be replaced by Stroll, spelt out the degree of trouble the firm has been in after core sales fell last year.  “The difficult trading performance in 2019 resulted in severe pressure on liquidity which has left the company with no alternative but to seek substantial additional equity financing,” she said.  “Without this the balance sheet is not robust enough to support the operations of the group.”  Now Aston will need to turn the financial lifeline into part of a sustainable plan as it delays investment in electric vehicles and cuts its operating costs.  A key future milestone includes around 1 billion pounds worth of debt due to mature in 2022. The company also suffers from lower gross margins than rival Ferrari, according to analysts at Jefferies, who have said scaling up is just as important as extra capital. Key to the company’s success is its first foray into the lucrative SUV market, a late entrant compared to many rivals such as Volkswagen-owned Bentley and BMW’s Rolls-Royce.  Aston has built a new factory in Wales to make the model, known as the DBX, which it hopes will attract more women to the brand and some buyers to purchase both it and a vehicle from its traditional line-up.  With the DBX model not due to roll off the production line until the second quarter of this year, the firm has taken the cost with only some of the benefit so far.  Based in central England, Aston said earlier this month that it already had around 1,800 orders for the car which will retail for 158,000 pounds in Britain, a “materially better” rate than for any previous models. “When we were looking at the amount of money needed, we were thinking about deleveraging, creating the liquidity buffer that was missing and also be able to continue investing in some longer-term critical products including the mid-engine platform,” said Philippe Houchois, equity analyst at Jefferies. Slideshow (2 Images)“All that works as long as DBX is successful so they have to deliver that,” he said.

    "Title": "Billionaire Lawrence Stroll shifts Aston Martin into the fast lane",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll has agreed to buy up to 20% of Aston Martin and rename his Formula One team after the 107-year-old company famed for being fictional secret agent James Bond’s car of choice. A decline in sales of Aston Martin’s luxury sports cars since it floated on the London Stock Exchange in October 2018 has put the company’s shares and finances under sustained pressure, forcing it to seek help.  Under the deal announced on Friday, Stroll will pay 182 million pounds for a 16.7% stake which could rise to 20% upon completion of the company’s plan to raise a total of 500 million pounds, including a rights issue from exiting shareholders. Aston Martin shares surged as much as 30% after the announcement and were 18% higher at 1038 GMT. The brand, which is mainly owned by Italian and Kuwaiti private equity groups, has come late to the lucrative sports-utility vehicle (SUV) market and has struggled to keep up with rivals owned by major global carmakers. Related CoverageAston Martin's lifeline buys carmaker time as SUV hits roadTimeline: Twists and turns in Aston Martin's long historyAston Martin had also held talks with Chinese carmaker Geely, which makes Volvos, but it wanted to instigate more fundamental change than the plan outlined on Friday, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters.  Aston Martin Chief Executive Andy Palmer said the consortium led by Stroll, who is behind the Racing Point F1 team and owns a fleet of vintage Ferraris, will bring several benefits.   “He brings with him his experiences and access to his Formula One team,” Palmer told Reuters.  “We’ve talked a lot in the past few years about wanting to be clearly rooted in luxury and obviously Mr Stroll knows an awful lot about luxury.” Stroll will join Aston Martin’s board as executive chairman, replacing Penny Hughes, who will step down.  FILE PHOTO: A worker cleans an Aston Martin Vantage car at Brussels Motor Show, Belgium January 18, 2019.  REUTERS/Francois LenoirUnder Friday’s agreement, Racing Point will become the Aston Martin F1 works team from the 2021 season. Stroll’s 21-year-old son Lance joined Mercedes-powered Racing Point last year from Williams and has Mexican Sergio Perez as team mate. Stroll, who made his money through investing in fashion brands such as Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors, has been involved in Formula One and motor racing for years and also owns Canada’s Mont-Tremblant circuit in Quebec. ‘DEMAND OVER SUPPLY’ Carmakers of all sizes are using alliances, partnerships and mergers as ways to share the cost and challenge of meeting new emissions regulations, electrifying model ranges and competing on new technologies such as autonomous driving.   The car sector has been hit by a decline in sales in China and a slump in diesel sales in Europe, prompting several automakers to post disappointing results, but Aston has also suffered as a small player.   Rivals such as Bentley, which is owned by Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of BMW, benefit from being part of major carmaking companies as they can share costs and expertise.  Slideshow (4 Images)But despite more stringent emissions rules coming in over the next few years, Aston Martin said plans to invest in electric vehicles will now be delayed beyond 2025 as part of cost-cutting measures.  The consortium led by Stroll is likely to include several other people such as JCB Chairman Anthony Bamford, entrepreneur Andre Desmarais, Michael de Picciotto, telecoms investor John McCaw and Hong Kong fashion sector investor Silas Chou, all of whom have worked with Stroll before. “I look forward to working with the board and management team... to continue to invest in the development of new models and technologies and to start to rebalance production to prioritize demand over supply,” said Stroll.

EssilorLuxottica, formed last year from the merger of French lens maker Essilor and Italian eyewear group Luxottica, gave up the chance to offer concessions on Thursday, the deadline for doing so, the European Commission website showed. Last year’s deal also triggered an investigation and feedback from nearly 4,000 opticians but was eventually cleared unconditionally.  The new deal will give EssilorLuxottica control of more than 7,000 stores worldwide. The Commission, which will open the full-scale probe following the end of its preliminary review on Feb. 6, and EssilorLuxottica declined to comment. Its shares dipped on the Reuters story and were down 0.8% in early trade. GrandVision was not immediately available for comment. The sources said retailers and rival lens makers had expressed concerns to the EU competition watchdog. EssilorLuxottica however has pointed to the growing market clout of independent and specialist lens makers. GrandVision, whose chains include Vision Express in Britain and For Eyes in the United States, sells brands including Varilux lenses and Ray-Ban sunglasses.

REUTERS/Toru HanaiTOKYO (Reuters) - Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) said on Friday it would spend 531.1 billion yen ($4.84 billion) to take full control of listed industrial equipment unit Hitachi High-Technologies (8036.T) through a tender offer. The Japanese industrial conglomerate is realigning its group portfolio as the government has pointed to corporate governance issues regarding dual listings of parents and subsidiaries. Hitachi will offer 8,000 yen a share for the firm, in which it now owns a stake of 51.73%. Shares of Hitachi High-Technologies closed at 7,920 yen on Friday before the news. The tender offer will run from Feb. 17 through April 6. Hitachi said the takeover would benefit the unit’s industrial equipment business by stirring in the group’s knowhow in digital technologies. Hitachi High-Technologies said in a statement that its board approved the takeover and recommended its shareholders tender their shares to Hitachi. Hitachi has been among the most aggressive of Japan’s conglomerates in reorganizing. Last month, the company said it would sell listed chemicals unit Hitachi Chemical (4217.T) for 494 billion yen to Showa Denko (4004.T) and the diagnostic imaging business to Fujifilm Holdings (4901.T) for 179 billion yen.

The settlement covered five current directors: Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis, Antonio Gracias, Stephen Jurvetson and Kimbal Musk. Brad Buss, who was a director at the time of the SolarCity deal, was also part of the settlement, which was paid from insurance policies, according to court documents.  “Plaintiffs probably think they have a cleaner shot on the merits if the only issues they have to raise are with Elon Musk and Elon Musk’s actions,” said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. The case was brought in the Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Tesla is incorporated, by an individual investor and five investment funds. Tesla said in a statement to Reuters in September the allegations were “based on the claims of plaintiff’s lawyers looking for a payday, and are not representative of our shareholders.” The suit represents another legal headache for Musk, who in the past two years has settled a lawsuit by securities regulators over his use of Twitter and won a defamation trial brought by a British cave explorer. Musk and the Tesla board also are scheduled to defend  Musk’s pay package at a trial in Delaware next year. At the heart of the current case are allegations that Musk and the other board members did not fully disclose the depth of SolarCity’s problems, or their own conflicts. SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Musk and his cousins, Lyndon Rive and Peter Rive, who were the company’s CEO and chief technology officer as well as directors. Musk was SolarCity’s  chairman and largest shareholder, and five of Tesla’s directors were direct or indirect owners of SolarCity stock. Entering 2016, SolarCity’s stock was on a sharp downward trajectory and the company was slashing its workforce and bleeding cash.  Tesla touted synergies of combining the companies in the all-stock deal, which was approved by Tesla shareholders. After the deal closed, Tesla slashed its solar sales force and ended a solar marketing deal with Home Depot Inc. Quarterly solar installations plummeted and are well below levels SolarCity enjoyed in its heyday.  Tesla has said Musk’s involvement in deal discussions and all other material information were accurately described to shareholders in public filings before the deal closed. On Wednesday, Tesla reported its second straight quarterly profit, sending its stock surging to an all-time high.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: The new Aston Martin Lagonda factory is seen in Saint Athan, Wales, Britain December 6, 2019.   REUTERS/Rebecca Naden/File Photo(Reuters) - British luxury carmaker Aston Martin (AML.L) will hold a board meeting on Thursday to decide whether to raise funds through the sale of a strategic stake, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters.  Famed for being fictional secret agent James Bond’s car of choice, the 107-year old company’s share price has plummeted since floating in October 2018 and it has come late to the lucrative sport utility vehicle market which boosted rivals. The Financial Times reported that Chinese carmaker Geely (0175.HK) and Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll are each offering to invest around 200 million pounds ($263 million) in return for 20% of the firm and a place on the board, adding that Aston could make an announcement as soon as Friday. A spokesman for Aston Martin declined to comment, referring to remarks made this month that it is holding discussions with potential strategic investors “which may or may not involve any equity investment into the company”. A source told Reuters this month that the Chinese carmaker was in talks with Aston about taking a stake, eyeing potential savings on technologies and vehicle platforms with integration between Aston and its own Lotus brand.  Carmakers of all sizes are using alliances, partnerships, mergers and equity stakes to share the cost and challenge of meeting new emissions regulations, electrifying model ranges and competing on new technologies such as autonomous driving.

    "Content": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline company Enbridge Inc said on Thursday its plan to sell nearly all capacity on the Mainline oil network for the long term is fair to shippers of all types and would benefit the western Canadian industry. Enbridge plans to allow shippers to book 90% of space under contracts on the nearly 3 million barrel per day Mainline, Canada’s biggest oil pipeline system, rather than continue to ration space on a monthly basis.  It made its application in December to the Canada Energy Regulator. “We went to great lengths in this proposal to make sure every producer, no matter how big or small, had an option to be involved,” Chief Executive Al Monaco said at a CIBC investor conference in Banff, Alberta. “Fair access to everyone is a key tenet.” The change will result in improved netback pricing for shippers and will better link the region’s oil with U.S. refiners and export channels, Monaco said.

    "Title": "Exclusive: In break from past, Louis Dreyfus boss is open to selling stake",
    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - After 169 years of keeping the business in the family, agricultural commodity giant Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) is open to selling a large non-controlling stake to an external stakeholder, its chairwoman told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: Olympique Marseille's owner Margarita Louis Dreyfus attends the inauguration of their soccer training centre in Marseille, January 28, 2011. REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier/File PhotoMargarita Louis-Dreyfus, who assumed control of the company in 2009, stressed she was in no rush and that an investor would have to strengthen the business. Last year, the billionaire businesswoman completed consolidating Louis Dreyfus Company Holdings B.V. (LDHBV) - the structure that holds the family’s shares in LDC - via her Akira family trust which now controls over 96% of the holding firm.  She has spent a decade negotiating costly and acrimonious buyouts of minority family shareholders, while profits at LDC declined in increasingly tough agricultural markets. “It is the first time in our almost 170-year history that we are prepared to open our capital to an external shareholder,” the 57-year-old said in an interview.  “But we are not under pressure. We want to keep majority control. Everything else depends on the quality of offers.” The group has previously indicated it could bring “regional players” into the business to help strengthen its positions in areas where it seeks expansion, such as China. Akira’s consolidation of LDC’s ownership has come at a cost: it borrowed $1 billion from Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) last year to buy out the minority shareholders, pledging its shares in LDC as collateral, its filing showed. Credit Suisse declined to comment. This comes at a time when LDC, like its rivals, faces a challenging business environment - with swine fever in China, which could hit economic growth and protein demand in the world’s largest consumer of pork, as well as the coronavirus outbreak.   ‘NOW COMPANY IS FREE’ LDC, also known as Dreyfus, is the “D” of the “ABCD” quartet of global agri-traders that also includes Archer Daniels Midland (ADM.N), Bunge (BG.N) and Cargill CARG.UL.   Like its peers, LDC has restructured operations, exiting activities including dairy and metals trading while focusing more on food processing, notably in Asia. The company’s top priority was to develop its business, said Louis-Dreyfus, a Russian-born Swiss citizen.  “Until 2018 we were in a process of consolidating the company’s shareholder structure. Now the company is free of that issue and can fully focus on the business.” A new investor should bring value to strengthen the company,  she said. “It is not only about size. It is also about quality.” Speculation about consolidation has been rife in the industry since takeover approaches for U.S.-based Bunge. Commodity group Glencore (GLEN.L) made an approach for Bunge two years ago and has said the sector needs consolidating. China’s COFCO International has also been seen as a potential bidder for other trading firms as it expands overseas. ‘ADAPTING TO NEW REALITY’ In October 2019, Dreyfus reported a first-half net profit from continuing operations of $73 million, down from $91 million a year earlier, and said international trade tensions and the swine disease epidemic would weigh on its annual profit. Full-year 2019 results will be published later this year. Louis-Dreyfus said it would show a “resilient” bottom line despite a challenging backdrop of swine fever and trade tensions, which depressed U.S. soybean imports into China. “We are adapting to a new reality of higher volatility and political unpredictability,” Louis-Dreyfus said, adding that a recovery of crush margins — the profits made from processing soybeans — and cost savings should help 2020 results. A cost-cutting programme announced internally in November is being led by new Chief Operating Officer Michael Gelchie, whose appointment was part of a recent management reshuffle, the latest in a series of changes. FILE PHOTO: Olympique de Marseille's majority owner, billionaire businesswoman Margarita Louis-Dreyfus attends a news conference in the Velodrome Stadium in Marseille, France, August 4, 2016. REUTERS/Philippe Laurenson -/File Photo“We are cautiously optimistic that we shall see a rebound in 2020,” she said. Over the past decade, Louis-Dreyfus has bought the shares of minority family members wishing to sell under a long-term arrangement established by her late husband, Robert. Akira increased its ownership in LDHBV to over 96% from 50.1%. “In fact, all we have been doing these years is following Robert’s guidance to develop the company’s strategy,” she said.

    "Content": "European Digital Economy Commissioner Margrethe Vestager reacts during a news conference on NBCUniversal antitrust case in Brussels, Belgium January 30, 2020. REUTERS/Johanna GeronBRUSSELS (Reuters) - NBCUniversal was fined 14.3 million euros ($15.86 million) by the European Union on Thursday for illegally restricting sales of merchandise linked to films such as “Minions”, as the bloc cracks down on practices blocking cross-border online trade. The European Commission opened an investigation into the Comcast subsidiary, and several other companies, on related issues in 2017 following an inquiry into the e-commerce and cross-border practices of thousands of companies in Europe. The EU wants to promote cross-border online trade to boost economic growth and catch up with the United States and Asia in this fast-growing business area. The Commission said NBCUniversal’s sales curbs included restricting out-of-territory sales by licensees, restricting sales beyond allocated customers or customer groups and restricting online sales to particular territories or to the websites of specific retailers. “Such sales restrictions undermine the very foundations of the EU single market and cannot be tolerated,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. The EU reduced NBCUniversal’s fine by 30% in return for  cooperation with regulators. Its film merchandising products include mugs, bags, clothing and toys for “Minions”, “Jurassic World” and “Trolls”. EU antitrust regulators fined Nike and Sanrio last year for similar illegal practices.

    "Title": "Warren Buffett gives up on newspapers; Berkshire sells unit to Lee Enterprises",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) agreed to sell its newspaper business to Lee Enterprises Inc (LEE.N) for $140 million in cash, abandoning an industry the billionaire investor had long defended even as its financial prospects deteriorated. FILE PHOTO: Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, pauses while playing bridge as part of the company annual meeting weekend in Omaha, Nebraska U.S. May 6, 2018. REUTERS/Rick Wilking The transaction includes 31 daily newspapers and 49 weeklies including the daily Omaha World-Herald in Berkshire’s hometown in Nebraska, Buffalo News in New York, Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia and Tulsa World in Oklahoma. Lee owns 50 daily newspapers including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and has since July 2018 managed Berkshire’s papers other than the Buffalo News, which Berkshire bought in 1977. As part of the transaction, Berkshire will also become Lee’s sole lender, refinancing the Davenport, Iowa-based company’s existing debt and lending $576 million at a 9% interest rate. A closing is expected in mid-March. Lee shares more than doubled in early trading on Wednesday and were last up 67 percent at $2.10. Berkshire has more than 90 operating businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Geico auto insurer, and bought most of its newspapers in the last decade. While newspapers are a small part of the conglomerate, it nonetheless remains unusual for Buffett, who delivered newspapers as a teenager, to sell an entire operating business. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Buffett tells shareholders on Berkshire’s website that he has “no interest at all” in selling good businesses, and is “very reluctant to sell sub-par businesses” expected to generate cash, be run well and have good labor relations. But he has lamented the newspaper industry’s decline, as the Internet deprives traditional newspapers of revenue streams. He told Yahoo Finance last April that the industry was “toast,” and told Berkshire shareholders in May 2018 that only the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and perhaps the Washington Post had digital models strong enough to offset declining print circulation and ad revenue. Buffett invested in the Washington Post’s former publisher for four decades and sat on its board, and was a confidant of one-time chief executive Katharine Graham. Employment in Berkshire’s newspaper units fell 23% to 3,685 at the end of 2018 from 4,761 three years earlier. The World-Herald was not spared. Dozens of jobs have been eliminated, including nearly all its business reporters, and the newspaper no longer covers Berkshire frequently. Journalists there voted to unionize in October 2018. In a statement, Buffett said Berkshire had “zero interest” in selling to anyone other than Lee. “No organization is more committed to serving the vital role of high-quality local news, however delivered, as Lee,” he said.

    "Title": "Centerview lures top French dealmakers to its new Paris hub: sources",
    "Content": "LONDON/NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. boutique investment bank Centerview has found an office in the heart of Paris and is hiring senior bankers to establish a second European hub as Brexit looms, three sources told Reuters. Exterior view of the building in which Centerview Partners has leased an office space in Paris, France January 24, 2020. REUTERS/Maya NikolaevaCenterview, which already has an office in London’s Mayfair, has rented space on the upmarket Avenue Matignon and plans to open for business in the next few months, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. The New York-based bank has held talks with a number of prominent dealmakers in Paris including the former boss of Lazard in France, Matthieu Pigasse, the sources said. Its target list also includes Deutsche Bank’s (DBKGn.DE) co-head of corporate and investment banking Emmanuel Hasbanian and Barclays (BARC.L) managing director Yann Krychowski, who specializes in financial services, the sources said. The two were recently approached by Centerview but an agreement over a possible move has yet to be found, they said. Centerview, Hasbanian and Krychowski declined to comment. Pigasse did not respond to a request for comment. The bank’s push into continental Europe comes with Britain set to leave the European Union on Jan. 31. Large investment banks and independent advisory outfits are bulking up their presence across Europe to ensure access to continental clients. The value of French mergers and acquisitions (M\u0026A) rose 2% last year to $193 billion, the third highest in the past decade, according to Refinitiv data. That was mainly due to a surge in outbound M\u0026A which spiked 33% to a record $115 billion, despite a general slowdown in European activity, the data showed. Citi (C.N) topped the French M\u0026A league table in 2019 followed by Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) with only three independent advisory firms - Lazard, Perella Weinberg \u0026 Partners and D’Angelin \u0026 Co - making the top 10. Centerview ranked fourth last year for global M\u0026A deals led by advisory boutiques with a 2.1% share of the overall fee pool. Lazard took the largest slice. FRENCH ROLLOUT Centerview is betting on a mix of junior and seasoned deal-makers to drive its French roll-out as it wants to become the advisor of choice for big French companies, the sources said. It recently landed a key advisory role representing U.S. jeweler Tiffany (TIF.N) in takeover negotiations with French luxury group LVMH (LVMH.PA) - a milestone transaction for French dealmaking in the United States. Pigasse, whose contract with Lazard ended on Dec. 31, would help Centerview woo large French clients. He has held talks about a senior role at Centerview in Paris but has yet to commit, the sources said. The U.S. bank, co-founded by Blair Effron and Robert Pruzan, is also close to poaching two other former Lazard dealmakers, Nicolas Constant and Pierre Pasqual, the sources said. Constant helped Pigasse advise French cosmetics giant L’Oreal (OREP.PA) while at Lazard, two of the sources said. Neither Constant nor Pasqual were immediately available for comment. Other M\u0026A newcomers in France include Perella Weinberg - the investment bank founded by Joe Perella and Peter Weinberg - and Greenhill \u0026 Co (GHL.N). Perella launched its Paris office in 2018, luring French bankers from Bank of America (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs while Greenhill picked Amelie Negrier-Oyarzabal, a former Lazard partner, to open its French hub in late 2019.  New York-based Evercore Inc (EVR.N) tapped headhunting firm Charta Partners last year to attract French bankers with long-standing relationships with the country’s key companies but has yet to open a local office.

    "Title": "EU deals another blow to U.S., allowing members to decide on Huawei's 5G role",
    "Content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU followed Britain’s example on Wednesday, allowing members to decide what part China’s Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] can play in its 5G telecoms networks and resisting pressure from Washington for an outright ban. The EU flag and a smartphone with the Huawei and 5G network logo are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration taken January 29, 2020. REUTERS/Dado RuvicEU countries can either restrict or exclude high-risk 5G vendors like Huawei from core parts of their telecoms networks, according to the new guidelines, which seek to address the cybersecurity risks to the bloc’s 28 countries at a national and EU level. Britain granted Huawei a limited role in its 5G mobile network on Tuesday, frustrating an attempt by the United States to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from the West’s next-generation communications.  Huawei is the world’s biggest producer of telecoms equipment, competing with Sweden’s Ericsson and Finland’s Nokia. The United States wants the world to ban Huawei from 5G networks on fears that its gear could be used by China for spying, allegations which have been strongly rejected by the company.  The European Union sees 5G as key to boosting economic growth and competing with the United States and China and its recommendations, agreed by EU members, are that individual countries assess the risks and decide whether to exclude suppliers from core infrastructure, confirming a Reuters report on Jan. 22. The approach means non-EU providers are welcome in Europe as long as they comply with the rules, Europe’s industry chief Thierry Breton told a news conference. “We are not picking on anybody, we are not ostracizing firms,” he said. Huawei welcomed the guidelines, describing them as non-biased and fact-based. EU governments were advised to use several 5G providers rather than depend on one company. The providers should be assessed on technical and non-technical factors including the risk of interference by state-backed companies, according to the guidelines. The Commission said it was ready to bolster the bloc’s 5G cybersecurity by using trade defense tools against dumping or foreign subsidies. The battle over Huawei has been compared to the Cold War antagonism with the Soviet Union. The United States is worried that 5G dominance is a milestone toward Chinese technological supremacy that could define the geopolitics of the 21st century. The EU, however, is hoping a collective approach based on a checklist of risks and targeted measures will take some of the U.S. pressure off.  Related CoverageFactbox: Huawei's involvement in telecoms networks around the worldHuawei says it welcomes EU guidelines on 5G securityLobbying group ETNO, whose members include Deutsche Telekom, Orange and Telefonica who all use Huawei equipment, had warned against disproportionate actions which may affect their investments.  “Europe’s decision-making on 5G should continue being based on facts, it should be proportionate to threats and build on a solid understanding of technology reality,” ETNO said in a statement. EU countries have until April to implement the guidelines and June to report on their progress.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: The Boeing logo is displayed on a screen, at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., August 7, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidBRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian antitrust regulator Cade on Monday approved Boeing Co’s purchase of Embraer SA’s commercial aviation division without restrictions, according to a statement on the agency’s website. Cade’s top administrative council could still call for a reconsideration of the case, putting the matter to a vote. The companies welcomed the move on Monday, with Boeing saying it remained confident of getting approval from the European Commission, the last hurdle to the transaction. The European Union has set an April 30 deadline to decide on the deal. Boeing has offered to pay $4.2 billion for 80% of Embraer’s commercial jet division, which builds passenger jets in the 70- to 150-seat segment. That puts it in direct competition with next-generation jets designed by Bombardier Inc and acquired by Europe’s Airbus SE, which rebranded them the A220 program.

    "Title": "Freeport CEO 'looking forward' to deals once expansion projects done",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Freeport-McMoran Inc (FCX.N), the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, would consider acquisitions, mergers or other deals once three ongoing expansion projects finish by 2022, Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in an interview on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: Freeport-McMoran CEO, Richard Adkerson poses for a picture during an interview with Reuters at the CRU's World Copper Conference in Santiago, Chile  April 9, 2019. REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido/File PhotoDemand for copper is projected to surge this decade because of the rising popularity of electric vehicles, which use twice as much copper as internal combustion engines. That, in turn, is expected to fuel an M\u0026A wave across the sector.     Despite that, Phoenix, Arizona-based Freeport’s shares are worth half what they were in 2010, dragged down by uncertainty over the company’s stake in a major Indonesian mine and debt from an ill-fated oil and gas venture. But those issues are largely behind the company, which is about to open a copper mine in the United States, is expanding Indonesia’s Grasberg mine and has launched an analytics program to boost production in Peru. Those projects should double the company’s cash flow and boost the company’s stock price, giving the company ammunition to consider deals, Adkerson told Reuters.    “I’m looking forward to having a new experience in my career toward accessing alternatives and deciding which way we go,” said Adkerson, an accountant by training who became CEO in 2003. Those alternatives could include buying part or all of another company, building new mines or other deals, he said.  “We don’t have a clear directive now on what that direction could be, but we will be attractively situated and will have an opportunity to add value through investments,” said Adkerson.  According to recent news reports, Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.TO) CEO Mark Bristow has spoken favorably of Freeport’s assets and a potential combination. Adkerson declined to comment. A Barrick spokeswoman declined to comment.     Adkerson, 73, said he has no plans to retire and is in good health.  “This is not a time that I’m thinking about walking away,” he said. Adkerson called the outbreak of a deadly coronavirus in China a “real black swan event.” The term is a reference to the book “Black Swan,” which looks at the potentially catastrophic effects of unpredictable events. Copper prices CMCUc1 have dropped more than 10% this month on concerns the virus could affect the global economy. Copper prices are closely linked to global economic health because the metal is used for construction and manufacturing. Freeport’s stock dropped more than 9% last Thursday due in part to virus concerns even as the company posted better-than-expected quarterly results.  Its shares were 2.5% higher at $11.175 in afternoon trading, along with a broad rally in global equity markets as investors took a less pessimistic view of the potential economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

    "Content": "LONDON (Reuters) - The boss of British supermarket group Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Mike Coupe, said he was not stepping down in May because of his failure to buy rival Asda last year. FILE PHOTO: Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sainsbury's leaves 10 Downing Street in London, Britain June 7, 2018. REUTERS/Toby MelvilleSainsbury’s agreed 7.3 billion pound ($9.6 billion) deal for Walmart (WMT.N) owned Asda was blocked by Britain’s competition regulator in April. Asked by BBC radio if he was paying the price for that deal not happening, Coupe said: “No, absolutely my choice.” “If you looked at our AGM (annual general meeting) last year, 99.5% of our shareholders voted for me to carry on doing what I’m doing,” he said. “It’s something I promised myself throughout my career that at the age of 60 I will stop and do something different with my life.” Coupe, who is 60 this year, has been at Sainsbury’s for 15 years, six as chief executive. Sainsbury’s said last week that Coupe would be succeeded as CEO by Simon Roberts, the current retail and operations director. Coupe was asked, given last year’s ruling by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), if it was now impossible for two big players, such as Sainsbury’s and Marks \u0026 Spencer (MKS.L) to merge. “I think it’s difficult at the moment, but ultimately I have a very strong view that the industry will consolidate,” he said. “You see the amount of change that’s going on in the world of retail...One way or another there’s going to be a significant rationalization of brands that you’ve taken for granted for a generation. “And that will happen...probably in the next five or ten years.” Coupe was speaking after Sainsbury’s committed to have net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, a decade ahead of the British government’s own target which it said “isn’t soon enough”.

    "Content": "The logo of Capgemini is pictured during the Viva Tech start-up and technology summit in Paris, France, May 25, 2018. REUTERS/Charles PlatiauPARIS (Reuters) - French consulting and IT services provider Capgemini (CAPP.PA) succeeded in securing more than half of the capital of smaller rival Altran Technologies, the French market regulator AMF said on Monday, marking a win against U.S. activist fund Elliott.  The AMF said Capgemini holds 53.6% of Altran’s share capital and at least 53.4% of the voting rights. The group - which faced a tussle with Altran shareholder Elliott over its offer price - had aimed to get the backing from just over half of Altran’s investors to pursue its bid.  Capgemini was advised by Lazard, while Altran worked with Perella Weinberg Partners and Citigroup. Earlier in January Capgemini had slightly raised the price of its friendly bid for Altran to 14.5 euros a share from 14 euros, valuing the company at 3.7 billion euros ($4.1 billion).  That move failed to convince Elliott, which has built up a stake of over 15% in Altran, to tender its shares to the group’s offer, which closed on Jan. 22. The AMF said Capgemini’s offer would be reopened to other investors, though it did not give a fresh timeframe.  Capgemini is hoping the deal will add to its services in industries from telecoms to aerospace and help it slash costs. Altran shares climbed 2% on Monday to 14.75 euros hitting a 4-month peak, a rare bright spot in a European stockmarket spooked by coronavirus fears.

    "Title": "India renews push to sell Air India, puts entire stake on the block",
    "Content": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India said on Monday it plans to sell its entire interest in Air India Ltd, making a renewed push to sell the flag carrier after it drew no bids in an effort to auction a majority stake almost two years ago. A document released on Monday showed March 17 as the deadline for submission of initial expressions of interest, and that any bidder must assume liabilities, including debt of 232.87 billion rupees ($3.28 billion). Substantial ownership and effective control of the airline must remain with an Indian entity, the government added. The potential sale of an airline kept aloft by a $4.2 billion 10-year bailout in 2012 comes as the government divests money-losing assets to manage the fiscal deficit. The latest offer should garner significant response partly because it involves a clean exit by the government, said CAPA aviation consultancy India head Kapil Kaul. “As the entire debt excluding aircraft debt is taken out of the deal, it signals a very determined effort to exit Air India, to allow taxpayers’ funds be utilized for the government’s social agenda,” said Kaul. Indian business house Hinduja Group and US-based fund Interups have expressed interest in buying the airline, the  Business Standard daily said.  It quoted Laxmi Prasad, the chairman and chief business architect of Interups, as saying the fund had initiated talks with the government and would like to make a case for certain aspects of the airline’s business to be included in the deal. The government in 2018 here tried to sell 76% of Air India and offload about $5.1 billion of its debt, with terms including the retention of all employees. InterGlobe Aviation Ltd’s (INGL.NS) IndiGo and Jet Airways Ltd (JET.NS) - which has since collapsed - initially showed interest, but opted out after the terms were disclosed. Steel-to-autos conglomerate Tata Group, widely viewed as a potential suitor for Air India, also decided not to bid after deeming the terms too onerous, sources told Reuters at the time. On Monday, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the government was open to suggestions and altering some provisions if the changes helped to find a buyer.  “We have gone into this exercise, months of planning and preparation have gone into it and this is not the final, final. The bidders are going to get 45 days, they are going to come back to us. It is an interactive process,” Puri told reporters. “We are open to revising, refining and tweaking our views.”   A successful bidder would win control of Air India’s 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas. It would also get 100% of low-cost arm Air India Express and 50% of AISATS, which provides cargo and ground handling services at major Indian airports, the bid document showed. The buyer would also have to provide 3% of the value of the airline’s equity as stock options for permanent employees. Air India has about 9,400 permanent employees and 3,600 fixed-term contract staff - including 1,850 pilots and 4,600 cabin crew - with benefits such as discounted air tickets and pensions. Its employees protested against the 2018 sale attempt, and it was not immediately clear if they would also resist the latest effort. The government said it would provide details on safeguarding employee interests in its final bid document. FILE PHOTO: An Air India Airbus A320neo plane takes off in Colomiers near Toulouse, France, December 13, 2017. REUTERS/Regis DuvignauA spokesman for the employee union did not have immediate comment. The government’s divestment plan could also face opposition from within, with Subramanian Swamy, an MP from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), threatening legal action against the sale. “This deal is wholly anti-national and I will (be) forced to go to court. We cannot sell our family silver,” Swamy said on Twitter.

    "Title": "AbbVie-Allergan $63 billion deal aided by Nestle, AstraZeneca buys",
    "Content": "ZURICH (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker AbbVie’s (ABBV.N) $63 billion tie-up with Allergan (AGN.N) is getting help from Nestle (NESN.S) and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) buying up products the Irish-domiciled company is shedding to placate regulators. FILE PHOTO: The Allergan logo is seen in this photo illustration November 23, 2015. To match special report USA-FDA/CASES REUTERS/Thomas WhiteAbbVie is swallowing Allergan to give it control of the lucrative wrinkle treatment Botox and to diversify a portfolio heavily dependent on its $19-billion-per-year arthritis drug Humira, the world’s best-selling medicine that is advancing toward U.S. patent expiration. Swiss food group Nestle bulked up its medical nutrition business with Allergan’s Zenpep, a product with 2018 sales of $237 million which treats people whose pancreases do not provide enough enzymes to digest fats, proteins and sugars. Nestle did not give financial details, but analysts from Zuercher Kantonalbank estimated the takeover could have cost the Vevey, Switzerland-based company more than $1 billion. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca is regaining rights to brazikumab, Allergan’s experimental drug against Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis. The European Commission said this month the immunology medicine must be divested because of the risk its development would be halted after AbbVie’s takeover because of competing medicines. “These definitive agreements represent significant progress toward the completion of our acquisition of Allergan,” Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie’s chairman and chief executive, said. With regulators wary of the deal’s anti-competitive potential, rivals are getting a chance to stock their own product shelves. Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who also gets Allergan’s Viokace, another pancreatic enzyme product, in Monday’s deal, is bulking up on nutrition products that combine properties of medicine and food as the Swiss company expands in areas where growth may outpace its mainstream food business. “This is a significant opportunity for our business in the United States,” Greg Behar, head of Nestle Health Science, said in a statement.  AstraZeneca’s pact for brazikumab marks a return of the inflammation medicine to the British drugmaker’s portfolio. In 2016, Astra had struck a licensing deal with Allergan worth up to $1.5 billion for the medicine. With its return to AstraZeneca, Allergan has agreed to fund development costs for brazikumab in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, including the creation of a companion diagnostic, AstraZeneca said in a separate statement. “This agreement creates an opportunity for us to complete the full development program and bring this potential new treatment option to patients as quickly as possible,” Mene Pangalos, Astra’s biopharmaceuticals research head. Even if Allergan must foot the development bill, analysts appeared underwhelmed, in part because AbbVie’s Skyrizi, or risankizumab, a similar medicine, has a head start. “This could be another autoimmune product to add to Astra’s portfolio, although it will be somewhat late to the market,” Liberum’s Alistair Campbell wrote in a note to investors.

    "Title": "Fiat Chrysler asks U.S. court to toss out GM racketeering claims: filing",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) on Friday urged a federal judge to throw out a General Motors Co’s (GM.N) lawsuit accusing Fiat Chrysler of racketeering and bribing officials of the United Auto Workers union to put GM at a multibillion dollar labor cost disadvantage.  FILE PHOTO: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) headquarters are seen in Turin, Italy, July 21, 2018. REUTERS/Massimo PincaFiat Chrysler’s motion to dismiss GM’s civil racketeering lawsuit was expected. The company has said GM’s lawsuit is baseless and aimed at disrupting the Italian-American automaker’s proposed merger with France’s Peugeot SA (PEUP.PA).  GM general counsel Craig Glidden told reporters in November the FCA-PSA merger had nothing to do with GM’s legal action.  Fiat Chrysler’s arguments were filed on Friday evening in   U.S. District Court in Detroit. In response, GM said it remained confident in the legal underpinnings of its case and will respond in court. “We are confident in the legal and factual underpinnings of our case, which have already been documented in part through the guilty pleas and admissions of FCA executives made in connection with the government’s ongoing criminal investigation”, GM said in a statement. GM sued Fiat Chrysler in November charging its rival with bribing officials of the United Auto Workers union in order to gain advantages in 2009 and 2015 labor contracts and have the UAW withhold those terms from GM. Fiat Chrysler’s now deceased Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne sat “at the center” of the schemes, GM charged in its lawsuit.  In its response Friday, Fiat Chrysler rejected GM’s claim that Marchionne tried to force a merger between GM and FCA by agreeing to labor contracts that favored the UAW. GM failed to show “why Mr. Marchionne would want to saddle FCA and GM with unfavorable CBAs (collective bargaining agreements) if his ultimate goal was to run the merged company (presumably on a profitable basis).”  GM’s accusations relied in part on revelations from an active federal criminal investigation of corruption within the UAW. That investigation began at Fiat Chrysler but has since spread to past and present UAW officials at GM. In its motion on Friday, Fiat Chrysler said GM’s lawsuit was “fatally flawed” for several reasons.  The lawsuit was filed after a four-year statute of limitations had expired, Fiat Chrysler argued. GM is not a direct victim of wrongdoing by FCA executives or UAW officials related to labor contracts, and so cannot bring a RICO action, FCA argued in its motion.  The UAW is such a large organization, “the notion that FCA seized control of the UAW by virtue of the alleged prohibited payments is implausible on its face,” the FCA brief stated.  Further, Fiat Chrysler argued that GM’s allegations about corrupt contract negotiations should be heard by the National Labor Relations Board, not by a federal court.

    "Title": "EU plans more protectionist antitrust rules, data sharing in policy shake-up",
    "Content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU plans to adopt more protectionist antitrust rules and encourage businesses to share data as part of an industrial policy overhaul aimed at giving European companies a sharper edge in global markets, a strategy document seen by Reuters shows. FILE PHOTO: European Union flags fly outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, April 10, 2019. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File PhotoDrafted by the European Commission and set to be unveiled in March, the strategy also includes the more aggressive use of  trade defense instruments against companies deemed to be benefiting unfairly from foreign subsidies. “Our vision is not about shielding uncompetitive industries or encouraging protectionist policies ... At the same time, the EU cannot be complacent about third countries or companies undermining fair competition in the single market on global markets,” the document said. “This strategy sets the contours of a new and assertive industrial policy what will enable the EU to remain a global economic power,” it added. Numerous EU countries and companies have called for Brussels to adopt a more ambitious and strategic industrial policy, complaining that others are able to take advantage of Europe’s open markets without being subjected to the same rules. That argument was cited by German conglomerate Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and French rival Alstom (ALSO.PA) in their failed bid to gain EU antitrust approval to create a European rail champion last year. Under the new policy blueprint, the Commission will evaluate and review EU competition rules to ensure that they are fit for purpose and contribute to a strong European industry at home and in the world. In light of the growing data economy, the new policy envisions setting up a legal framework to facilitate the use, access to and sharing of data in a push to get companies to embrace artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. It will also promote more “Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI)”, building on the success of an 8-billion-euro battery project involving seven EU countries and 17 European companies approved last year. Such alliances are foreseen in clean hydrogen technologies and low-carbon industries as well as in microelectronics, the paper said. The new strategy warns foreign governments against unfairly shoring up their companies while restricting access to their markets, with the EU ready to use existing tools or create new ones if necessary, and also reinforcing customs controls. “The EU will mobilize all relevant tools including rule-making, standards, international financial instruments, trade agreements, public procurement and intellectual property rights to leverage its strengths and advantages,” the document said.

    "Title": "Bombardier scrambles to craft rail merger with Alstom, Hitachi: sources",
    "Content": "LONDON/MONTREAL/PARIS (Reuters) - Bombardier (BBDb.TO) has approached France’s Alstom (ALSO.PA) and Japan’s Hitachi (6501.T) to find a merger partner for its rail business as it struggles to contain costs that have eaten into margins, sources told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: A worker walks in front of a Bombardier advertising board at the SBB CFF Swiss railway train station in Bern, Switzerland, October 24, 2019. REUTERS/Denis BalibouseThe Canadian manufacturer of planes and trains is working with Citigroup (C.N) and UBS (UBSG.S) to strike a deal that could help create a rail champion to better compete with China’s state-backed operator, CRRC. Rail companies are eyeing consolidation to reduce costs through scale in a market dominated by CRRC, the world’s largest train maker. Bombardier has seen its share price plunge 37% since the start of the year after it flagged a 2019 profit warning on Jan.16. It has been reviewing several rail merger scenarios in recent months which also involved a possible deal with Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE) and a Chinese counterpart, but these options failed to gain traction, one of the sources said. It remains in active talks with Alstom, one of its closest rivals in Europe, while also looking at Hitachi as another merger option, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. Bombardier, Alstom, Hitachi and Siemens all declined to comment. Discussions with French industrial group Alstom began in July and became serious in September, one of the sources said. The French government is open to a rail deal for Alstom but no final decision has been made on the terms of a potential transaction, another source said. Alstom, advised by Rothschild, was only recently involved in a similar rail merger with Siemens - a deal set to create a European rail powerhouse but subsequently halted over antitrust concerns. Berenberg analysts said that there would be less of a regulatory barrier to a deal between Alstom and Bombardier since the pair has a lower European market share in high-speed rail and signaling. Japanese conglomerate Hitachi was also approached last year, the sources said, but it was not immediately clear whether the talks are still ongoing. Hitachi’s biggest rail market in Europe is Britain where there is little overlap with Bombardier’s operations. Yet both companies are active in Germany where concentration may raise concerns among European authorities, one of the sources said. Bombardier’s selection of its preferred merger partner will ultimately hinge on the likelihood of winning antitrust approval and the remedies that can be offered to soothe competition concerns, the sources said. European regulators are set to review two-decade old rules that determine if companies have the market power to hammer rivals - a move that could help Bombardier win consensus for its rail deal. GROWING PRESSURE Bombardier sold 30% of its rail business to Canada’s second-largest pension fund, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, in 2015 after reviewing strategic options including a possible listing in Germany or Britain. However, the unit has since struggled to cope with a handful of problematic rail contracts which have eaten into its margins, leading Bombardier to issue a profit warning for 2019. FILE PHOTO: A logo of Alstom is seen at the Alstom's plant in Semeac near Tarbes, France, February 15, 2019.   REUTERS/Regis DuvignauThe company recently slashed its guidance for its fourth-quarter earnings due to delays in business jet deliveries and higher rail costs. The plane-and-train-maker, which has $9.7 billion in outstanding bonds according to Refinitiv data, faces growing pressure to quickly raise money from its transport unit, one of the sources said. “They are serious about this. Without a deal the outlook is bleak,” he said.

    "Content": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba/ZURICH (Reuters) - Food company Nestle SA (NESN.S) said on Friday it has teamed up with small Canadian plant-based food ingredient makers Burcon (BU.TO) and Merit Functional Foods, the second such supply agreement this month that targets Canadian crops.  FILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured during the 152nd Annual General Meeting of Nestle in Lausanne, Switzerland April 11, 2019. REUTERS/Denis BalibouseMeat substitutes from plants in burgers, nuggets and many other foods are a fast-growing industry, driving up demand for crops that produce them. Canada is among the world’s largest growers of peas and the biggest producer of canola, crops high in protein that technology companies like Burcon can separate and isolate for use in foods and beverages. The agreement with Nestle is long-term, with no expiry, Burcon Chief Executive Johann Tergesen said in an interview. Nestle will buy pea and canola proteins from a 20,000-tonne-per-year Merit plant to be built by the end of this year in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Merit will process the proteins using Burcon technology under a licensing agreement.  “It’s a little bit like Christmas morning for those of us who have been doing this for 20 years,” Tergesen said. “In the early days, I had to explain to people what protein was. Now it has been a wild ride.” Burcon stock jumped 36% in Toronto to C$1.89 per share, touching its highest price in nearly three years. Nestle stock rose 0.9% in Switzerland. With the deal, Burcon expects to report its first-ever commercial revenue and profit in 2021. Terms were not released. Nestle launched soy and wheat protein-based “Incredible Burgers” in Europe last year. The deal gives the company access to a range of ingredients for its foods and beverages, using the “unique expertise” of Burcon and Merit, Nestle Chief Technology Officer Stefan Palzer said. It comes after Beyond Meat Inc (BYND.O) this month struck a similar supply agreement with France-based Roquette, which is also building a pea protein plant in Manitoba. The new commercial demand “provides a real sense of optimism for the future,” said Gord Bacon of Pulse Canada, an industry group representing pulse farmers and processors. “To have a diversified market base is what every group producing commodities or ingredients in Canada would hope for.”  With so much of Canada’s peas exported raw, finding enough supply to satisfy the Nestle deal will not be a challenge, said Ryan Bracken, Merit’s co-CEO. The company is already planning to expand the Winnipeg plant under construction to more than double production.

    "Title": "Apple pushes back against EU common charger, warns of innovation risks",
    "Content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - iPhone maker Apple on Thursday pushed back against EU lawmakers’ call for a common charger, warning the move could hamper innovation, create a mountain of electronic waste and irk consumers. FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Mike SegarApple’s comments came a week after lawmakers at the European Parliament called for a common charger for all mobile phones and amended a draft law to say the ability to work with common chargers would be an essential requirement for radio equipment in the bloc. A move to a common charger would affect Apple more than any other companies as its iPhones and most of its products are powered by its Lightning cable, whereas Android devices are powered by USB-C connectors. “We believe regulation that forces conformity across the type of connector built into all smartphones stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, and would harm consumers in Europe and the economy as a whole,” Apple said in a statement. It said regulation was not needed as the industry is already moving to USB-C through a connector or cable assembly.  “We hope the (European) Commission will continue to seek a solution that does not restrict the industry’s ability to innovate,” Apple said. A study by Copenhagen Economics commissioned by Apple showed that consumer harm from a regulatory-mandated move to a common charger would cost at least 1.5 billion euros, outweighing the 13 million euros in associated environmental benefits. The European Commission, which acts as the executive for the EU, has been pushing for a common charger for more than a decade. In 2009 it got four companies including Apple, Samsung, Huawei [HWT.UL] and Nokia to sign a voluntary memorandum of understanding to harmonize chargers for new models of smartphones coming into the market in 2011. The voluntary approach is not working and it is time to look into legislation, Commission officials said. “A delegated act based on the Radio Equipment Directive (RED) is one of the options to be considered since it empowers the Commission to take certain type of regulatory measures in this field,” the one of the officials said.  Another option was to pass legislation on the issue. “...given the limitation in the scope of RED and of its empowerment, any action through ordinary legislative procedure and/or through other instruments, such as implementing measures under the Eco-design Directive should be further explored and thoroughly assessed,” the official said. The Commission will publish a study around the end of the month or early February on the impact of a common charger.

    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Creditors of bankrupt Philadelphia Energy Solutions are opposing the sale of its oil refinery to Hilco Redevelopment Partners, saying another developer made a more lucrative bid for the site, according to court documents filed on Thursday. FILE PHOTO: The Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery is seen at sunset in front of the Philadelphia skyline March 24, 2014. REUTERS/David M. Parrott/File PhotoIndustrial Realty Group submitted a bid of $265 million during an auction last week to sell the idled refinery site, $25 million more than Hilco’s bid, according to filings by law firm Brown Rudnick LLP in United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. PES did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The refiner announced on Wednesday that it agreed to sell its 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery, the largest and oldest on the U.S. East Coast, to Chicago-based real estate developer Hilco, naming Industrial Realty Group as a back-up bidder.  PES’s unsecured creditors, which include companies that had supplied contract work to PES, as well as workers’ unions employed by the refinery, have pushed for a buyer that would restart the complex. Hilco’s proposal for the more-than 1,300-acre (530-hectare) site would result in a permanent shutdown of the plant, Brown Rudnick said, leaving those contractors and union members out of work. The attorneys did not say whether Industrial Realty Group intended to revive any or all of the idled refining complex, which shut over the summer after a June fire destroyed one of its key fuel processing units. PES filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July.  PES’s bankruptcy plan, which includes the Hilco agreement, is scheduled to be submitted for court approval on Feb. 6. PES creditors will also vote on whether they approve of the plan. If creditors reject the plan, that would put pressure on PES to prove its bankruptcy proposal is the best option for paying back creditors, the court filing said.  PES’s unsecured creditors also took issue with other elements of the plan, including bonuses for refinery executives and that it fails to resolve a $1.25 billion insurance dispute.

    "Title": "Activist hedge fund Elliott sells stakes in Hyundai Motor companies: paper",
    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: Employees of Hyundai Motor Group leave after the company's new year ceremony in Seoul, South Korea, January 2, 2020.   REUTERS/Kim Hong-JiSEOUL (Reuters) - Elliott Management sold all its shares in Hyundai Motor Group companies last year after it was thwarted in its campaign for huge special dividends and board seats, South Korean media reported.  The U.S. activist hedge fund was not among the December 2019 year-end list of shareholders at any of the Hyundai companies it targeted, the Korea Economic Daily reported, citing an unidentified investment banking source. A Seoul-based representative for the fund declined to comment. Hyundai Motor also declined to comment. Elliott held more than $1 billion worth of shares in Hyundai Motor (005380.KS), Kia Motors (000270.KS) and Hyundai Mobis (012330.KS), an Elliott unit said in April 2018.  Its efforts to shake up the family-run conglomerate had some success when a 2018 Hyundai-backed shareholder vote on a restructuring proposal, seen aimed at aiding the handing of the group’s reins to heir apparent Euisun Chung, was canceled. But in March 2019, the companies’ shareholders rejected Elliott’s demands for 7 trillion won ($6.2 billion) in one-off dividend payments and seats on the boards of Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Mobis. “From Hyundai Motor’s perspective, Elliott kept talking about excess capital and asking for dividends, a lot of money. But the company rejected it by insisting it has a lot of investment needs,” said Lee Han-joon, analyst at KTB Investment \u0026 Securities.  “I’m sure they will breathe a little easier as Elliott leaves.. they will have more room to utilize capital,” Lee said.   A recent recovery in the share prices of the Hyundai firms may have influenced the move, the newspaper said, citing the source.

    "Title": "Real estate developer in $240 million deal to buy Philadelphia refinery",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Real estate developer Hilco Redevelopment Partners has entered into a $240 million agreement to purchase the Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) oil refinery, which was the largest and oldest on the East Coast, according to court documents on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: The Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery is seen at sunset in front of the Philadelphia skyline March 24, 2014. REUTERS/David M. Parrott/File PhotoChicago-based Hilco submitted the winning bid, which includes an escrow amount of $30 million, in an auction last week for the Philadelphia site, documents filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware show. The sale still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court, and Los Angeles-based developer Industrial Realty Group, LLC, was selected as the backup bidder, the documents show. The plan is scheduled to be submitted to the court for approval on Feb. 6, and PES can withdraw the sale plan at any time before then. The refiner filed for bankruptcy in July last year and put its 335,000-barrel-per-day plant up for sale a month after a fire and explosions destroyed part of the refinery. Hilco, which has acquired 5,000 acres (2,023 hectares) in North America, specializes in redeveloping obsolete industrial sites, dimming the prospect that the PES complex will be resurrected as an oil refinery. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement the city is optimistic Hilco will develop the more than 1,300-acre site in a way that is more environmentally friendly and contributes to the regional economy, but it expects challenges and years of work ahead. “We welcome the selection of Hilco Redevelopment Partners as the winning bidder for the refinery site,” Kenney said. City officials met with bidders during last week’s auction and were briefed on the track records of the various parties, but they were not given specific details of the proposals.  Hilco did not respond to requests for comment on its plans for the South Philadelphia site, which has been used to store and process hydrocarbons for about 150 years.  However, a stakeholder who was briefed by Hilco representatives in the days prior to the auction said the company intended to use part of the site for light industrial purposes, including storage.  A sale to a real estate developer, either Hilco or IRG, does not preclude former bidders from leasing space on the site, according to two sources familiar with other proposals for PES.  More than a dozen groups showed initial interest in buying  PES, but only one publicly stated intentions to revive the site as an oil refinery at full capacity.  That group, led by former PES Chief Executive Officer Phil Rinaldi, was not a finalist. It is attempting to partner with one of the real estate groups in a lease agreement, two sources familiar with the plan said. Rinaldi could not be reached for comment.  S.G. Preston Co, a biofuels company based in Philadelphia, is also expected to seek a lease agreement with the next owner, according to a source familiar with the situation. FILE PHOTO: A boat passes beside the Philadelphia Energy Solutions plant refinery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., August 21, 2019. REUTERS/Mark Makela/File PhotoWith PES’s closure, more than 1,000 workers were laid off, including 640 local United Steelworkers members. Many former PES workers held out hope that the plant would be restarted, said former USW Local 1-10 leader Ryan O’Callaghan. With the prospect of a real estate owner, however, many of those workers are expected to consider moving out of state to find similar work, O’Callaghan said.  “Some hard decisions are going to be made by a lot of families,” he said.

    "Title": "Fiat Chrysler CEO: Peugeot merger talks progressing well",
    "Content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler’s (FCHA.MI) chief executive Michael Manley said on Wednesday that merger talks with Peugeot owner PSA (PEUP.PA) to create the world’s No. 4 carmaker are progressing well and he hopes to have a deal within 12-14 months. Michael Manley, CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and president of European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), speaks during a news conference in Brussels, Belgium January 22, 2020. REUTERS/Yves HermanSpeaking to Reuters on the sidelines of an industry meeting, he said he doesn’t expect any major obstacles that could delay a final agreement. “Talks are progressing really well,” Manley said about negotiations with the French carmaker ahead of a briefing by the European automotive association (ACEA), of which he is president. His comments come a month after the two carmakers agreed a binding deal worth about $50 billion to combine forces in response to a slowdown in global demand and mounting costs of making cleaner vehicles amid tighter emissions regulations. Manley’s timeline for completing the deal by early 2021 is in line with a forecast made by the companies in December. Fiat and Peugeot are now getting into the details of how the merger will work, including choosing which vehicle platforms - the technological underpinnings of a vehicle - will fit which products in a combined company. Because customers in different locations still prefer vastly different cars, there is room for multiple platforms in a combined group, Manley said.  “That global platform is an elusive beast,” he added. “This concept of a massive global platform in my mind is almost a myth but that doesn’t mean to say we’re not going to recruit significant volume.” (GRAPHIC - Fiat Chrysler vs Peugeot in a snapshot: here) Reporting by Edward Taylor and Marine Strauss; Writing by Josephine Mason; Editing by Keith Weir, Kirsten DonovanOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "Title": "Google CEO eyes major opportunity in healthcare, says will protect privacy",
    "Content": "Sundar Pichai, Chief Executive Officer of Alphabet, gestures as he speaks during a session of the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2020. REUTERS/Denis BalibouseDAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet Inc and its Google subsidiary, said on Wednesday that healthcare offers the biggest potential over the next five to 10 years for using artificial intelligence to improve outcomes, and vowed that the technology giant will heed privacy concerns. U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about Google’s access to the health records of tens of millions of Americans. Ascension, which operates 150 hospitals and more than 50 senior living facilities across the United States, is one of Google’s biggest cloud computing customers in healthcare. “When we work with hospitals, the data belongs to the hospitals,” Pichai told a conference panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “But look at the potential here. Cancer if often missed and the difference in outcome is profound. In lung cancer, for example, five experts agree this way and five agree the other way. We know we can use artificial intelligence to make it better,” Pichai added. Google has spent several years developing artificial intelligence to automatically analyze MRI scans and other patient data to identify diseases and make predictions aimed at improving outcomes and reducing cost. The U.S. lawmakers asked the company in November to provide information about other health systems that provide information to Google, whether Ascension clients will be allowed to opt out of the project, and whether the data be used for advertising. Pichai said there was already strong privacy protecting regulations in place that provide a framework for Google to operate. Google clinched a deal in November to acquire Fitbit Inc for $2.1 billion, aiming to enter the wearables segment and invest in digital health. The acquisition is expected to be scrutinized closely by regulators before it is allowed to close.

REUTERS/Kate Munsch -/File Photo(Reuters) - Shared workplace operator WeWork said on Wednesday it sold cloud and analytics services provider Teem to digital workplace solutions provider iOFFICE, as it offloads non-core businesses after a botched initial public offering last year. WeWork also sold a minority stake in The Wing, a community space provider designed for women, to a group of new investors including Google Ventures and American actress Mindy Kaling. Existing investor Sequioa Capital also participated. The company did not reveal the financial terms of the transactions.  The money-losing office space operator is under pressure to cut costs after it pulled its IPO last year and recorded a steep plunge in valuation to less than $8 billion from $47 billion.   WeWork also said it was in the process of selling other non-core ventures such as Meetup and Managed by Q.  The company said it has wound down restaurant co-working startup Spacious and will shutter Manhattan-based private school WeGrow at the end of the 2020 school year. In December, WeWork sold Conductor, a content marketing technology company. WeWork secured a $1.75 billion credit line with Goldman Sachs (GS.N) in December. The facility is expected to be available within the coming weeks, the company said. However, a separate deal to secure $3 billion from Japan’s three biggest banks has stalled as the lenders have hit internal limits, complicating a $9.5 billion rescue package for WeWork, Reuters reported in December.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Eurazeo hires banks for $2.2 billion sale of payments firm Planet - sources",
    "Content": "LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European buyout fund Eurazeo (EURA.PA) has hired Citigroup (C.N) and Evercore to prepare the sale of its payments business Planet in a deal that could value the Irish firm at up to 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion), three sources told Reuters. FILE PHOTO: The Citigroup Inc (Citi) logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017.  REUTERS/Chris HelgrenEurazeo wants to launch an auction process in March as it seeks to capitalize on the rise of online shopping and mobile phone payments, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Citi and Evercore won a contest in December to handle the sale, which comes just days after U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake agreed to merge Planet’s rival Global Blue with Far Point - a vehicle set up by hedge fund Third Point and led by the former president of the New York Stock Exchange. Eurazeo declined to comment. Citi and Evercore were not available for immediate comment. Planet, based in Galway on Ireland’s west coast, serves more than 400,000 merchants and 100 partner banks and provides both tax refunds and a wide range of payments services. Paris-based Eurazeo took control of New York-listed Planet Payment in 2017 through Fintrax Group, a portfolio company which specialized in currency-conversion services that enabled card holders traveling abroad to pay for goods in their own currency. The combined group was rebranded Planet and has since grown its international presence, employing more than 1,500 staff in 64 markets across five continents. Eurazeo is looking to cash out at a multiple of 15 to 20 times Planet’s core earnings of more than 100 million euros, two of the sources said, with the final price tag expected to be comfortably above 1.5 billion euros. The sale will target Asian and Western companies as well as other investment funds, one of the sources said. Planet’s closest competitor is Dutch payments specialist Adyen (ADYEN.AS) which was listed in Amsterdam in 2018 by a pool of investors including General Atlantic and Temasek.  Adyen, which processes payments for companies including Airbnb and Netflix (NFLX.O), has a market value of 23.5 billion euros and trades at 56 times its expected core earnings. Other European payments firms such as Worldline (WLN.PA) and Nexi (NEXII.MI) trade at roughly 18.5 times their expected core earnings, according to Refinitiv data. Growth in payment systems has kept deals rolling even as potential mergers in other sectors have stalled on concerns about trade tensions and a global economic slowdown. Once a backwater of banking, the payments sector is now lucrative and fast-growing and is attracting growing interest from private equity investors. Blackstone and CVC are currently exploring a possible listing of Britain’s Paysafe Group.

REUTERS/Lucas JacksonTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s most prominent activist investor on Wednesday demanded Toshiba Machine Co (6104.T) hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting to discuss its plans to introduce defense measures against a hostile takeover. The demand from investor Yoshiaki Murakami came a day after he launched a hostile bid of up to $235 million for control of the company. Toshiba Machine has said it could adopt poison-pill measures to fend off acquisition attempts by issuing stock warrants to existing shareholders and diluting the holdings of unwanted suitors. In a letter sent to the former Toshiba Corp (6502.T) subsidiary on Wednesday, an investment company backed by Murakami said the implementation of defense measures without shareholders’ approval would be “unacceptable”. Toshiba Machine said it is examining Murakami’s tender offer. If the company decides to adopt the poison-pill defense without shareholders’ approval, the Murakami side would seek a court injunction against the measures, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. Separately on Wednesday, BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) said in a regulatory filing that the world’s largest asset manager has built a 5.12% stake in Toshiba Machine for purely investment purposes.

FILE PHOTO: The Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery is seen at sunset in front of the Philadelphia skyline March 24, 2014.  REUTERS/David M. Parrott/File PhotoThe agreement between PES and Hilco, a Chicago-based developer that specializes in redeveloping industrial properties, is expected to be announced as soon as Tuesday. PES and Hilco did not respond to requests for comment. A city official declined to comment. Any sale would have to be approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. A sale to Hilco would reduce the possibility that the more-than 1,300-acre (526-hectare) Philadelphia site would be resurrected as an oil refinery. Hilco, which has $2.5 billion of assets under management and has acquired 5,000 acres in North America, specializes in redeveloping obsolete industrial sites, according its website.  However, it is possible that Hilco could lease the site to a refinery, biofuels or other heavy industrial operation, two sources said.  The 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery is the largest and oldest on the U.S. East Coast, but was shut after a fire and series of explosions on June 21 last year that destroyed a key processing unit. PES filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a month after the blaze and put the 150-year-old refining operation up for sale. There were more than a dozen initial bidders for the site. Only one of the groups, led by PES Chief Executive Officer Philip Rinaldi, had publicly stated intentions to revive the site as an oil refinery. A bankruptcy court hearing is set for Feb. 6, which could confirm any potential sale of the site.  PES had struggled financially for years and had only exited a previous bankruptcy in 2018. More than 1,000 workers were laid off after the site closed last summer, including roughly 600 United Steelworkers local union members.  Hundreds of other workers belonging to unions that provided  labor on a rotating basis to the refinery were also put out of work there.  PES’s unsecured creditors, which includes companies that had long supplied contract work to PES, as well as the unions, have pushed for a buyer that would restart the refinery, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Community members have protested against a restart of the plant, which has been one of the city’s biggest polluters.

    "Title": "Air France-KLM proposes buying 49% of Malaysia Airlines, JAL seeks smaller stake: sources",
    "Content": "KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Proposals to invest in ailing Malaysia Airlines include one from Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA), which wants as much as 49%, while Japan Airlines (9201.T) is looking at a 25% stake, people with knowledge of the matter said. FILE PHOTO: Malaysia Airlines planes are pictured at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Sepang, Malaysia, July 22, 2019.  REUTERS/Lim Huey TengDomestic carrier AirAsia Group Bhd (AIRA.KL) and Malindo Air, the Malaysian arm of Indonesia’s Lion Air, have also submitted proposals, the people added. Air France-KLM said it had previously held talks with Malaysia Airlines’ owners but was not currently involved in the sale process. Malaysia’s government has found the proposals from foreign airlines more attractive, but the sovereign wealth fund that owns Malaysia Airlines favors a deal with AirAsia, one of the sources said. “The bids from the foreign carriers are more comprehensive and strategic as both plan to capitalize on the strategic location of Malaysia for their operations,” said the source. The Malaysian government has been seeking a strategic partner for its national airline, which has struggled to recover from two tragedies in 2014 - the mysterious disappearance of flight MH370 and the shooting down of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine. That year, it was taken private by sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional Bhd [KHAZA.UL], which paid 1.4 billion ringgit ($345 million) for the 30% of shares it did not already own. The sources declined to be identified as the discussions are confidential. Representatives for AirAsia and Malindo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In an e-mailed statement, Air France-KLM said it maintained the “active yet pragmatic” approach to industry consolidation it had outlined to investors in November. “Air France-KLM had previously been in contact with Malaysia Airlines’ shareholders, but at this stage Air France-KLM is not a current party to the sales process of Malaysia Airlines,” the Franco-Dutch airline group said. Japan Airlines (JAL) said it was looking to expand its partnership with Malaysia Airlines through their joint venture,  but declined to comment on reports of a potential investment in the company. The government has received five proposals as part of a review that started last year, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday, although he declined to name the suitors.     There is no official timeline for a deal, but one source has said the government wants to get an investor finalised this quarter. MAHATHIR AND KHAZANAH AT ODDS Malaysia Airlines last year signed a joint venture agreement with JAL covering flights between Malaysia and Japan, which the Japanese airline said could be expanded in the future to cover U.S. flights. Malaysia Airlines and JAL are both members of the oneworld airline alliance, while Air France-KLM is part of the rival SkyTeam alliance. Sources said Air France-KLM had proposed setting up a hub for maintenance, repair and overhaul services in Malaysia, while Japan Airlines had offered to make the Southeast Asian country its regional hub, including for low-cost flights. “An international solution is probably better in this situation as AirAsia would have competition concerns,” one of the sources said. “This is still a work in progress but the story is around the potential for a massive hub in Southeast Asia and it’s clear that international airlines see value in Malaysia Airlines because of this,” the source said. Business news website Focus Malaysia said on Monday, citing an official document, that Khazanah had been pushing for AirAsia to merge with Malaysia Airlines. It also said AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes had proposed a three-way merger between the company, its long-haul unit AirAsia X (AIRX.KL) and Malaysia Airlines. Khazanah, which appointed Morgan Stanley last year to advise on potential options for the airline, said it was working closely with the government.

REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng“While there have been several proposals in this regard, a review of the options available to us is still ongoing,” it said in a statement. But Mahathir, who is also chairman of the board at Khazanah,  said he was “not completely happy” with the way the fund had been evaluating the proposals. “Unfortunately, Khazanah has got its own agenda so I have to check them,” he said.

    "Title": "Uber cuts losses from Eats business in India with sale to Zomato",
    "Content": "BENGALURU (Reuters) - Uber (UBER.N) has sold its loss-making online food-ordering business in India to local rival Zomato in exchange for a 9.99% stake in the startup backed by China’s Ant Financial. FILE PHOTO: An Uber Eats food delivery courier walks with a bicycle in central Kiev, Ukraine September 9, 2019. REUTERS/Valentyn OgirenkoZomato, valued at around $3 billion after raising money from Ant this month, will take over Uber Eats’ operations from Tuesday.   Since launching in India in 2017, Uber Eats has struggled to gain market share and is a distant third to Tencent Holdings (0700.HK)-backed Swiggy and Zomato.  All three have spent heavily on deals and discounts to attract customers in a highly competitive market. Uber chief financial officer Nelson Chai said the move was another demonstration, following its decision to exit Uber Eats South Korea in October 2019, “of our commitment to take a hard look at Eats markets where we do not have a path to leadership”. The San Francisco-based firm, which has promised to be profitable at an operational level by the end of 2021, has been trying to sell the India Eats business for a year, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.   It earlier held talks with Swiggy for a similar deal, but those fell through due to valuation and regulatory issues, two of them said. Uber and Swiggy did not respond to requests for comment. Uber Eats’ India operations contributed just 3% of gross bookings for the business globally in the first nine months of last year, while accounting for a quarter of its adjusted operating losses, the company said. The unit in India made a loss of $61 million for the three months to Sept. 30 on revenue of $20 million, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Zomato reported a loss of $294 million for the year to March 2019, while Swiggy made a loss of $330 million. The sale will allow Uber to cut its losses and yet keep a stake in a market expected to be worth $15 billion by 2023. Independent brand consultant Harish Bijoor said the deal would also allow Uber to focus on its strengths. “It should stick to what its competence is, in terms of being an aggregator of cabs,” he said.   Zomato’s orders per month should rise by 10 million from the 38 million to 40 million it was clocking before the deal, a source familiar with the deal said. Swiggy too receives around 40 million in monthly orders.  The acquisition does not guarantee that all Uber Eats customers will switch to Zomato. Online food delivery customers tend to favor companies offering the best deals, market research shows. Consultancy Frost and Sullivan said that even after the acquisition, Swiggy remains arguably the country’s leading market player.  “Swiggy’s diversification into a variety of last-mile delivery services, including store, package and home meal deliveries, is expected to offset any potential losses due to Zomato’s acquisition of Uber Eats,” it said in a note.

REUTERS/Toby MelvilleMILAN (Reuters) - European competition authorities are expected to rule on the London Stock Exchange’s $27 billion takeover of data and analytics company Refinitiv “around the summer”, an LSE board member said on Tuesday.  LSE (LSE.L) agreed in August to buy Refinitiv in a deal aimed at offering trading across regions and currencies and establishing the British company as a rival to Bloomberg, triggering speculation about the possible sale of assets to gain antitrust approval and to fund the deal. “The Milan stock exchange is a strategic asset for LSE, it is not up for sale at the moment”, LSE director Raffaele Jerusalmi, who is also the chief executive of Borsa Italiana, said on the sideline of an event in Milan.  Jerusalmi said he did not see any issues in terms of overlap between bond platforms MTS and Tradeweb, which are owned, respectively, by LSE and Refinitiv. The LSE-Refinitiv deal came just 10 months after a consortium led by U.S. asset manager Blackstone (BX.N) completed a leverage buyout of Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO).

    "Title": "Embraer studies turboprop to be developed through Boeing venture",
    "Content": "DUBLIN (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (EMBR3.SA) is in the advanced stages of studying the launch of a new turboprop aircraft to be developed through a venture it is planning with Boeing, subject to necessary approvals, a top executive said on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Embraer's commercial aviation chief John Slattery poses for picture during the launch of the E195-E2 commercial jet's first prototype in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, March 7, 2017. REUTERS/Roosevelt Cassio/File PhotoThe aircraft would be in the same size range or even larger than the 70-seat ATR-72, a Franco-Italian aircraft that currently dominates the market, Embraer Commercial Aviation Chief Executive John Slattery told Reuters. “It sits in our target market, which we have always been clear is below 150 seats, and will have natural adjacency to the E2 offering,” he said, referring to Embraer’s family of 80-120-seat regional jets. “The business case is going well.” Analysts say such a move could shake up a market dominated by ATR, which controls four-fifths of global sales in competition with the Q400 turboprop, sold by Bombardier last year to Longview Aviation of Canada and renamed the De Havilland Canada DHC-8.  China is also targeting the market with its Xian MA700. Analysts say turboprops are more efficient than jetliners over short distances, especially when oil prices are high.  Speaking as the aviation industry poured into Dublin for annual Airline Economics and Airfinance Journal conferences, Slattery said he believed a move by Embraer into turboprops would force a response from ATR and boost choice for airlines. He said ATR had a “de facto monopoly” because of recent marketing challenges facing its smaller Canadian rival.  ATR did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ENGINE DISCUSSIONS ATR claims to be the world’s most profitable aircraft manufacturer with double-digit margins, though it does not publish financial data separately from its co-shareholders, Europe’s Airbus (AIR.PA) and Italy’s Leonardo (LDOF.MI). It predicts demand for 2,390 deliveries of turboprop passenger aircraft with 61-80 seats over 20 year to 2037.     Embraer is also in “meaningful” discussions with engine makers General Electric (GE.N), Rolls-Royce (RR.L) and Pratt \u0026 Whitney Canada (UTX.N) about an engine for the new plane, Slattery said. Pratt is currently the sole turboprop supplier. Any launch decision would need to be backed by Boeing. Embraer is studying the plan as it tries to complete a 2018 agreement to fold its commercial aircraft activities into a venture to be controlled by Boeing (BA.N).  The deal has won approval from several regulators but the European Union has launched a detailed competition review. Slattery said Embraer would not go ahead with the project on a standalone basis because of the cost - estimated at billions of dollars - and other priorities.  But he stressed there was no connection between the turboprop study and talks with regulators over the rest of Embraer’s commercial airplane activities. “The amount of balance sheet required for a new state-of-the-art commercial aircraft is of an order of magnitude that we simply don’t have the appetite for, outside of the joint-venture environment,” Slattery said, adding, “no JV, no TP”. He added he did not expect any such hurdle to arise because Embraer remains confident the Boeing deal will be approved on its merits, citing the support of several purchasing airlines. European Union regulators investigating the $4.2 billion tie-up have asked for more than 1.5 million pages of information and data on over 20 years of sales campaigns, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.

    "Title": "Global FDI dips, hit by Hong Kong divestment, Brexit: U.N.",
    "Content": "GENEVA (Reuters) - Global direct foreign investment (FDI) dipped slightly around the world last year, hit by massive divestment in Hong Kong and a drop in flows into Britain due to Brexit uncertainty, the United Nations said on Monday. FILE PHOTO: Euro, Hong Kong dollar, U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, pound and Chinese 100 yuan banknotes are seen in this picture illustration, January 21, 2016.   REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration/File PhotoFDI could rise marginally in 2020 on the back of modest growth as trade tensions between China and the United States ease, but geopolitical uncertainties and protectionist pressures are tempering expectations, it said. In 2019, global FDI flows were estimated at $1.39 trillion, down 1% from a revised $1.41 trillion in 2018, the U.N. trade and development agency UNCTAD said in a report. FDI, which includes cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M\u0026A), intra-company loans and investments, is a bellwether of globalization and a potential sign of future growth of corporate supply chains. Investment flowing into the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, the Asian financial hub that has been wracked by political unrest, nearly halved last year to $55 billion, the report said. “In Hong Kong there was $48 billion of divestment in terms of equity,” James Zhan, UNCTAD’s senior director of investment and enterprise, told Reuters. He noted that the former British colony was also affected by Sino-U.S. trade tensions. Competition from Shanghai and Shenzhen in mainland China as well as Singapore for high-end FDI, such as regional business hub functions and R\u0026D activities of multinationals, also weighs on Hong Kong, he said. “Hong Kong’s economy is a solid economy. Longer term-wise, it is attractive for international investment,” Zhan said.  Britain, beset by uncertainty last year over the outcome of Brexit but now on course to leave the European Union on Jan. 31, saw inward FDI flows shrink by 6% to an estimated $61 billion last year, according to the report. FDI flows to developed economies fell by 6% last year to an estimated $643 billion, and remained at a historically low-level, at half of their peak in 2007, it said.  FDI to the EU as a whole fell by 15% to $305 billion, as several countries experienced “strong volatility”, it said.  The EU and some member states have tightened their FDI entry screening, particularly over “national security concerns”, Zhan said, and this could deter some FDI especially in technology. Flows to the United States, the largest FDI recipient worldwide, were stable at $251 billion. The report said the impact of a 2017 U.S. tax reform that reduced U.S. outward FDI flows appears to have ebbed. FDI flows to developing economies remained stable at an estimated $694 billion, led by China with a flat $140 billion.

    "Content": "FILE PHOTO: Paul Ryan speaks after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, U.S., December 20, 2018.  REUTERS/Jim Young(Reuters) - Fox Corp debuted on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, marking a new phase for billionaire Rupert Murdoch’s media business after the $71 billion sale of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc’s film and television assets to Walt Disney Co. The company also appointed former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Chief Executive Officer of Formula One Group Chase Carey and two others to its board. Carey was president and chief operating officer at Twenty-First Century Fox from 2009 to 2015. The newly spun-off media company, which will house assets including Fox News Channel and Fox Broadcast Network, is expected to bring in around $10 billion in annual revenue. Brokerage MoffettNathanson had started covering Fox with “buy” rating last week ahead of the debut, saying Fox Broadcasting Network and Fox News are “an unrivaled pair of must-have” content that will drive strong, industry-leading revenue growth for years.  Meanwhile, Disney’s deal got the last approval from Mexico’s telecoms regulator last week, subject to conditions including the sale of Fox Sports channels. The U.S. Justice Department too has asked Disney, which owns cable sports network ESPN, to divest Fox’s 22 networks that provide sports programming for regional and local markets. Disney won a bidding war last year against cable company Comcast Corp to acquire Twenty-First Century’s film and TV assets.

FCA’s statement came after Taiwan’s Hon Hai - the parent of Foxconn - announced the potential joint venture in a separate statement. It “would enable the parties to bring together the capabilities of two established global leaders across the spectrum of automobile design, engineering and manufacturing and mobile software technology to focus on the growing battery electric vehicle market,” FCA said. Intesa Sanpaolo analyst Monica Bosio described the possible deal as “positive”, though it was not expected to have a significant impact on FCA fundamentals in 2020 and 2021.  “It should help FCA and the future combined entity FCA-PSA to shorten its gap in the electric vehicles and in Asia,” Bosio said. In further evidence of how traditional carmakers are accelerating their electric push into the world’s largest auto market, Germany’s Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) is set to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co, two sources told Reuters. FCA said it was in the process of signing a preliminary agreement with Hon Hai, aiming to reach final binding agreements in the next few months.  However, it added there was no assurance that final binding agreements would be reached or would be completed in that timeframe.  With a share of China’s passenger car market of around 0.35%, FCA currently operates in the country through a loss-making joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group (GAC).  However, the joint venture does not produce electric models, raising doubts it could meet China’s tough emissions rules and green car quotas. FCA Chief Executive Mike Manley last year said the group had “streamlined” the structure of its Chinese partnership and appointed a new leadership to improve its competitiveness.  Foxconn has been investing heavily in a variety of future transport ventures for several years, including Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride services giant, and Chinese electric vehicle start-ups Byton and Xpeng. Foxconn also has invested in Chinese battery giant CATL and a variety of other mostly Chinese transportation tech start-ups.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Volkswagen to buy 20% of Chinese battery maker Guoxuan amid electric push - sources",
    "Content": "HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) is set to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd, two sources told Reuters, as the German firm accelerates its electric push into the world’s largest auto market. FILE PHOTO: A Volkswagen electric ID car is seen during a construction completion event of SAIC Volkswagen MEB electric vehicle plant in Shanghai, China November 8, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song/File PhotoThe deal would mark Volkswagen’s first direct ownership in a Chinese battery maker and comes as the Wolfsburg-based automaker strives to meet a goal of selling 1.5 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) a year in China by 2025, including plug-in hybrid cars. The top foreign automaker in China plans to acquire the stake in Shenzhen-listed Guoxuan via a discounted private share placement in the coming weeks, the two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Based on Guoxuan’s market capitalization of $2.8 billion, a 20% stake in the company at present is worth about $560 million.  The deal’s details have been mostly finalized and the two firms are waiting for new Chinese regulatory rules on private share placements that will provide a more flexible pricing mechanism and shorter lock-up periods for majority shareholders, said one of the people, speaking on condition of anonymity. After the stake purchase, Volkswagen will become the battery maker’s second-largest shareholder with a 20% stake, behind Zhuhai Guoxuan Trading Ltd, a firm controlled by Guoxuan’s founder Li Zhen, which currently holds 25%.  Shares in Guoxuan surged by their maximum 10% on the news on Friday to trade at their highest level since March last year.  Volkswagen declined to comment. Guoxuan and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. An executive at Guoxuan’s board secretary’s office told the government-backed Securities Times newspaper it had not yet received news about a stake acquisition. SECURING SUPPLIES  Guoxuan is among a swathe of mid-tier Chinese battery makers behind CATL and BYD. It is based in China’s eastern city of Hefei, where Volkswagen is also building electric vehicles with JAC Motor, one of a number of its Chinese joint venture partners. A third source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Volkswagen has long wanted to control a battery maker to better manage its supply chain. To achieve its NEV sales goal in China, Volkswagen has built a new $2.5 billion electric vehicle plant with partner SAIC Motor that will have annual output capacity of 300,000 cars and is also revamping manufacturing facilities in China’s southeastern city of Foshan to build electric cars with partner FAW Group. Volkswagen has also identified CATL as a strategic supplier and Volkswagen board member Stefan Sommer told Reuters in July last year that it could even build its own battery cell manufacturing plants in China. “By holding a stake in the top Chinese battery makers, carmakers can gain more bargaining power on battery prices,” said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight. “Foreign carmakers are now catching up with their Chinese counterparts on securing battery supplies in China.”  Slideshow (2 Images)Volkswagen’s rivals in China include Tesla, which earlier this month began delivering cars from its $2 billion factory in China. The U.S. electric car maker eventually plans to manufacture 250,000 vehicles a year in the plant’s first phase.  China has been a keen supporter of NEV - pure battery electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrids - and has started implementing NEV sales quota requirements for automakers. However, cuts to subsidies have dealt the market a blow, with NEV sales contracting for the first time last year. Sales this year are likely to be flat or rise only slightly, according to China’s top auto industry association.

    "Title": "Eli Lilly targets quarterly deals of $1 billion-$5 billion in 2020: CFO",
    "Content": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) aims to announce roughly one $1 billion to $5 billion deal every quarter in 2020, its chief financial officer told Reuters, as the U.S. drugmaker looks to build up its pipeline of future products.  FILE PHOTO: Josh Smiley, senior vice president and chief financial officer for Eli Lilly and Company, speaks during an interview in San Francisco, California, U.S. January 13, 2020. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File PhotoIt will focus largely on earlier stage opportunities across key therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, immunology, and neurology, CFO John Smiley told Reuters in an interview at the JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco earlier this week.  Eli Lilly has been on a deal-making spree in recent years in a bid to increase products and sales in core franchises as older blockbuster medicines, such as diabetes treatment Humalog, face generic competition and pressure to lower prices. Last week, it announced a $1.1 billion deal to buy dermatology products maker Dermira Inc (DERM.O). With the purchase, Lilly will acquire Dermira’s experimental treatment for atopic dermatitis, a serious form of eczema, which is in late-stage testing, as well as an approved medicated cloth to treat excessive armpit sweating. “We are looking at Dermira-like opportunities targeting assets in the $1 billion to $5 billion range,” Smiley said. “We’d like to be doing something in the range of one per quarter or so.” In 2018 and 2019, it announced several deals for cancer companies, including an $8 billion acquisition of Loxo Oncology. U.S. regulators in 2018 approved Vitrakvi, Loxo’s first commercial medicine, which treats a wide variety of cancers triggered by a rare genetic mutation.   In a presentation to investors this week, Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks said most of its deals will be in the cancer space, but that other therapeutic areas remain of strong interest as well.  While the company is still looking at late-stage assets, Smiley said the most opportunity for shareholders is in drugs  in earlier stages of development.  Deals could include licensing agreements, outright acquisitions, or other structures, he added. In its most recent earnings call, Lilly forecast a higher-than-expected profit for 2020, citing growing demand for its newer medicines including diabetes drug Trulicity and Taltz for psoriasis and other related autoimmune diseases. However, sales of Trulicity and other newer medicines have been crimped by high rebates and discounts drugmakers pay to middlemen, such as pharmacy benefit managers, in order to make sure patients have access to their products.

    "Title": "Exclusive: Cyber security firm McAfee hires new CEO",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - McAfee LLC told Reuters on Thursday it has hired Peter Leav, the former CEO of BMC Software, as its new CEO, replacing Chris Young, who created the cyber security company in its current form by carving it out of Intel Corp four years ago.  FILE PHOTO: McAfee Chief Executive Officer Christopher Young delivers a keynote speech at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Sergio PerezThe move gives McAfee the option of pursuing an initial public offering with a new leader. It has also considered deals in the sector, including potentially merging with NortonLifeLock Inc. Young will become a senior advisor at buyout firm TPG, which acquired a majority stake in McAfee from Intel Corp in 2016 in a deal which valued the company at $4.2 billion, including debt. Young will work with TPG on new technology investments. During Young’s tenure, the company saw mid-single digit revenue growth, according to a person familiar with the matter. Leav previously served as president and CEO of BMC, a business software firm, for three years. He left in 2019, a few months after the completion of private equity firm KKR \u0026 Co’s $8.5-billion buyout of the company. He will start as McAfee CEO on Feb. 3.  “Peter has exactly the right mix of experience and expertise to lead McAfee in its next phase of growth,” said TPG co-CEO and McAfee Chairman Jon Winkelried.  The global cyber security industry was valued at $116.5 billion in 2018, and is forecast to grow around 11% per year through to 2025, as the number of cyber security threats continues to rise, according to research firm Grand View Research. TPG has yet to make a decision on the timing or manner of its exit from McAfee, according to a person familiar with the matter. In the last few years, McAfee has managed to grow its main cyber security software business, which focuses on consumers, through price increases, new partner programs and good retention rates, according credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service Inc. This growth has been partially offset, however, by weakness in its business of serving other companies, which remains competitive, according to Moody’s. In November, NortonLifeLock, previously called Symantec, sold its enterprise business serving other companies to chip maker Broadcom Inc for $10.7 billion.

    "Title": "T-Mobile/Sprint urge court for deal approval, states warn of price hikes",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of U.S. states suing to block T-Mobile US Inc from merging with Sprint Corp on Wednesday told a federal judge that the deal would raise prices for consumers, while the phone companies pushed back and emphasized they would compete aggressively to push prices down.  T-Mobile US Inc Chief Executive Officer John Legere departs a hearing at Manhattan Federal Court during the T-Mobile/Sprint federal case in New York City, New York, U.S., January 15, 2020.  REUTERS/Lucas JacksonThe states filed a lawsuit in June to block the merger, saying it would harm low-income Americans in particular. T-Mobile and Sprint contend that the merger would enable the combined company to compete more effectively with dominant carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT\u0026T Inc.  U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero, who will decide the fate of the merger, heard closing arguments in the case on Wednesday. Marrero did not ask any questions of either party and said he would make a decision “as promptly as possible.” Glenn Pomerantz, a lawyer for the states, said that the case would impact at least 130 million customers, since a merger would leave the United States with three major phone carriers instead of four. “If this merger goes forward, they’re at risk for paying billions of dollars more every single year for those services,” he said. When T-Mobile majority shareholder Deutsche Telekom first contemplated the deal in 2010, it “expressly and unambiguously admitted that it had potential to reduce price competition,” Pomerantz said.  David Gelfand, an attorney representing T-Mobile, said in his closing statement that the merger would offer cost savings, which would trickle down to lower prices for consumers.  The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish Network Corp, which would create its own cellular network to ensure that there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October.  Executives from the companies, including outspoken T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere, testified during the trial that Sprint’s business was deteriorating and would not survive if it did not merge with T-Mobile. The carriers argued that selling Sprint’s prepaid business and some wireless spectrum to Dish Network Corp would help the satellite TV provider become a mobile competitor and preserve a fourth wireless company in the industry. The states, led by New York and California, maintained that Dish was ill-equipped to become a competitive fourth wireless carrier, and said Wednesday that Dish lacks experience, scale and brand recognition in wireless. In rebuttal, Pomerantz emphasized that Sprint could turn itself around the same way T-Mobile had previously when it launched 4G technology. “They’re not in a dire position; they’re in an advantageous situation and they just need to invest in their business and compete,” he said.

    "Title": "Renault, Nissan say alliance not headed for break-up",
    "Content": "TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Renault (RENA.PA) recovered some lost ground on Tuesday after the French carmaker and its Japanese partner Nissan Motor (7201.T) rejected media reports that their alliance was in danger of being dissolved. Growing concerns about the state of the 20-year old French-Japanese alliance, forged by former boss turned fugitive Carlos Ghosn, had sent Renault and Nissan shares skidding to multi-year lows on Monday.   At the opening of trading in Paris on Tuesday, Renault shares rose 1.3 percent, before falling back slightly to trade up 0.49 percent by 08:23 GMT. The alliance, which also includes Japan’s Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T), is “solid, robust, everything but dead,” the chairman of Renault, Jean-Philippe Senard, told Belgian newspaper L’Echo. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire also weighed in, saying reports some executives wanted to break up the alliance were “malicious.” Speaking to France’s CNews TV, he also said he expected Renault to name a new chief executive within days to replace Thierry Bollore, a Ghosn-era appointee who was ousted in October. Luca de Meo, who stepped down as the head of Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) Seat brand last week, is seen as a frontrunner for the job, although a stringent non-compete clause in his contract firm may prove a hurdle, sources have told Reuters.     Nissan, in response to “speculative international media reports,” said it was “in no way considering dissolving the alliance.” “The alliance is the source of Nissan’s competitiveness,” the Japanese automaker said in a statement.  “Through the alliance, to achieve sustainable and profitable growth, Nissan will look to continue delivering win-win results for all member companies.” Concerns emerged about the future of the Renault-Nissan partnership after the November 2018 arrest in Japan of Ghosn, the man who did more than anyone else to hold together the disparate alliance of often-contrasting carmaking cultures. Those worries were given new momentum after Ghosn last month fled Japan where he was awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct — which he denies —, flew to Lebanon, and told the media the alliance was riven with mistrust. Renault shares hit six-year lows on Monday as investors worried the French group’s 20-year cost-sharing alliance with Nissan was headed for a break-up without Ghosn to hold it together. A Financial Times report on Monday that Nissan executives were making contingency plans for a split with Renault appeared to accelerate a sell-off in the French manufacturer’s shares.

The $5.3 billion price given in Monday’s statement is double what Plaid was reportedly valued at during its last fundraising, when it took a $250 million Series C round that was announced in December 2018. It was later revealed by Plaid that both Visa and rival Mastercard Inc were investors in that round. “Plaid is a leader in the fast growing fintech world,” Visa Chairman and CEO Al Kelly said in Monday’s statement.  “The acquisition, combined with our many fintech efforts already underway, will position Visa to deliver even more value for developers, financial institutions and consumers.” Founded in 2013 and currently connecting with over 11,000 financial institutions across the United States, Canada and Europe, Plaid will be able to use the acquisition to leverage Visa’s global brand in expanding its own business, according to a source familiar with the matter. Visa expects the deal to close in the next three to six months and benefit its adjusted earnings per share at the end of the third year.  Visa said it will fund the deal using cash on hand as well as debt that will be issued at a later date. The acquisition would not impact upon Visa’s previously announced stock buyback or dividend plans. Visa and Plaid respectively used Lazard and Goldman Sachs as their financial advisors.

    "Title": "The real price of Occidental's 'costless' oil hedge",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - In just 12 days, Occidental Petroleum Corp pulled off one of the biggest hedges against falling oil prices ever placed by a U.S. energy company. It characterized the transaction as “costless” but a Reuters review of regulatory filings, market data and interviews shows that’s not the whole story. FILE PHOTO: The logo for Occidental Petroleum is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidThe aim of the complex financial maneuver, the company said, was to help preserve Occidental’s generous dividend to shareholders as it sought to take over rival Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last summer in the biggest industry deal for years. “With the additional leverage from the Anadarko acquisition, these new hedges will strengthen our 2020 cash flow in a low oil price environment, and provide additional assurance that our dividend is safe, while we are deleveraging,” Occidental’s Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher told an earnings call in August. However, to secure the hedge swiftly and discreetly and to avoid paying its bankers a fee for arranging it, the company took a bigger potential hit to future revenues with only limited protection against falling oil prices, according to a source with direct knowledge of the transaction.  While Occidental disclosed the financial details of the hedge in filings, fulfilling its regulatory obligations, the fact that the company took on the additional risk to secure the transaction fast and to avoid banker fees has not been previously reported. Occidental declined to comment for this story.  Hedges are used by a variety of companies. Airlines use them to protect against rising fuel prices and energy producers use them to lock in revenue, usually by buying a put option, a type of derivative contract, which gives them the right to sell oil at a predetermined future price. Occidental used a complex series of transactions for its hedge, which was arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, according to six sources with direct knowledge of the trades. The summer hedge covered nearly 110 million barrels of oil, or 300,000 barrels a day, each for 2020 and 2021, nearly enough to meet the annual oil imports of Australia. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment.   For a graphic on how the hedge was executed, click on [tmsnrt.rs/35L1B3p]. The hedge meant the firm could sell the oil at a minimum of $55 a barrel in 2020, even if crude prices fell below that, to a limit of $45 a barrel; but the company’s selling price was capped at $74.09, and it would lose out on any revenue earned from oil prices rising beyond that mark.  Occidental capped revenues for 2020 and also 2021 but only got downside protection for 2020 - a lopsided deal sometimes referred to as a naked hedge. Limiting future revenue without getting a guarantee against falling prices is unusual in the energy sector. While Occidental has disclosed the details of the 2020 hedge in regulatory filings, the absence of a hedge against falling oil prices in 2021 was not explicitly mentioned. The company said the 2021 options were meant to increase the maximum selling price it would receive for 2020 sales. “Occidental entered into the 2021 call options to substantially improve the ceiling price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes in 2020,” it said in a filing. Some analysts said investors should have been given more information about the potential implications of the hedge. “It seems very strange that they left a naked hedge in 2021 which capped upside but offered no downside protection,” said David Katz, president and CIO of Matrix Asset Advisors, which owns 0.3% of Occidental’s shares. However, other analysts said Occidental needed to secure a hedge quickly to defuse some of the pressure from investors. “Doing this gives Oxy a lot of flexibility in 2020 with cash flow,” said Trisha Curtis, President of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advisory firm specializing in U.S. shale. “You can’t have an acquisition that big and then willy-nilly hope that oil prices hold up. Regardless of what it cost them, it was needed for a number of reasons.”  (GRAPHIC: Breaking down Occidental's hedge - here)     REVENUE-LIMITING OPTIONS Occidental has said publicly that it does not regularly hedge its oil sales because it does not want to give up potential revenue. The last time the company hedged was in 2005, also following an acquisition.  In the summer of 2019, Occidental was under pressure to demonstrate that its dividend was being protected. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn was campaigning against the Anadarko deal and Anadarko itself had issued a regulatory filing on July 29 saying its calculations showed that Occidental, even without an acquisition, would not be able to generate enough cash to pay its dividend for the next three years. Occidental executives wanted to be able to announce the hedge to reassure investors when they presented second-quarter results on July 31, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the transaction.  Bank of America and Citigroup had been advising Occidental on the Anadarko acquisition. Now their traders had about two weeks to complete the hedge. Acting on Occidental’s behalf, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup sold two types of derivative contracts, with the intention of using the proceeds from the sales to fund the purchase of a put option locking in Occidental’s oil revenues at $55 a barrel for 2020, according to the six sources. In illiquid private markets, big transactions are more difficult, and therefore more expensive, to execute. If rival traders get wind of a deal before it is fully executed, they could get in first with their own buy or sell orders, pushing up or down the target price. In the case of Occidental’s hedge, the large volume of oil and the tight time frame to insure it meant the banks were not going to be able to raise enough money from selling derivative contracts for 2020 alone to cover the cost of the hedge, the first source said.  To fill the gap and avoid having to present Occidental with a large bill, the banks sold similar revenue-limiting options for 2021, the source said. Selling the 2021 options also increased the amount of money the banks could make because they were selling additional contracts on Occidental’s behalf. Derivatives trades require only minimal disclosure and it is unclear how much of a profit the banks made from the Occidental deal. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment. FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor by the post that trades Anadarko Petroleum and Occidental Petroleum at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 30, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermidIn the first week of 2020, international oil prices spiked by around 9% to nearly $72 a barrel due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. They have since fallen back to around $65, $2 above the price they are expected to average out at over 2020, according to the most recent Reuters poll. If those expectations pan out, Occidental will not miss out on potential profits, so the bet would work out. On the other hand, if oil prices were to surge again, and remain above $74 a barrel, the cost to Occidental could translate to millions of dollars a month in lost revenues, even at just $1 above the price cap.  Despite the hedge underpinning its dividend, Occidental shares have fallen by nearly a third since April, when its interest in Anadarko first became public.

    "Title": "Peugeot family aims to quickly raise PSA-Fiat Chrysler stake: newspaper interview",
    "Content": "PARIS (Reuters) - The Peugeot family, which will own a 6.2% stake in the new carmaker resulting from PSA (PEUP.PA) and Fiat Chrysler’s (FCHA.MI) merger, aims to increase its holding as soon as possible, a representative said in a newspaper interview. FILE PHOTO: The logos of car manufacturers Fiat and Peugeot are seen in front of dealerships of the companies in Saint-Nazaire, France, November 8, 2019. REUTERS/Stephane MahePSA and Fiat Chrysler reached a binding agreement last month on a $50 billion tie-up that will create the world’s No. 4 carmaker after the deal is completed in 12-15 months. Under the terms of the deal, the Peugeot family can increase its shareholding by up to 2.5% only by acquiring shares from French state investment bank Bpifrance Participations and China’s Dongfeng Motors, which are both also PSA shareholders. Asked by regional French newspaper L’Est Republicain if raising the stake was a major objective, Jean-Philippe Peugeot, who heads the family’s Etablissements Peugeot Freres holding company, replied that it was. “There was a complex negotiation in order to obtain this possibility. It wasn’t necessarily a foregone conclusion. Once the merger is complete, my family will give favorable signals,” Peugeot told the newspaper. A PSA spokesman told Reuters that Peugeot’s remarks were “in line with what had been indicated” when the deal signed. FCA declined to comment. Peugeot also said that he expected the French state, represented through Bpifrance, to eventually exit the new company. “I think that it is not meant to be there forever. It will undoubtedly remain long enough to make sure that (French) jobs are safe over time,” he said. However, he added that it was unlikely that Dongfeng would totally sell out of the new group even though it plans to reduce its shares in PSA. “Partially, perhaps, but I don’t think all of it. Sure, PSA’s business in China has not met our expectations, but for Dongfeng it’s a minor issue when you look at China’s long history,” he said.

    "Content": "The logo of German car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz is seen at Brussels Motor Show, Belgium January 9, 2020. REUTERS/Francois LenoirBEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz will build smart-branded electric cars with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group [GEELY.UL] in the Chinese city of Xian from a base with annual capacity of around 150,000 vehicles, a senior official from its German parent Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) said on Saturday. Daimler’s Executive Vice President in China Leng Yan made the comments to Reuters on the sidelines of China’s EV100 forum in Beijing, an annual event where senior auto industry executives meet to discuss policies and the market. Geely and Mercedes-Benz said on Wednesday they would each invest 2.7 billion yuan ($388.8 million) in a China-based venture to build “premium and intelligent electrified” vehicles under the Smart brand. Like Mercedes-Benz, Smart is a Daimler marque. The firms said at the time that the venture, which will be based in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo, will have manufacturing capacity in China and sales operations in China and Germany. Geely, which holds a 9.7% stake in Stuttgart-based Daimler, is building car plants in Xian, according to construction bidding documents on its website. Daimler, which partners with BAIC Group [BEJINS.UL] to make luxury Mercedes-Benz cars in Beijing, also builds trucks with BAIC’s unit Beiqi Foton Motor (600166.SS). Smart delivered about 116,800 vehicles worldwide in 2019, Daimler said in a Jan. 9 statement.

    "Title": "U.S. refinery sales hit the brakes, with 5% of capacity on block",
    "Content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - From coast to coast, U.S. refineries are available for the taking, but nobody is buying. FILE PHOTO: The Philadelphia Energy Solutions plant refinery is seen in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., August 21, 2019. REUTERS/Mark Makela/File PhotoWith the news that Royal Dutch Shell Plc is looking to unload its Anacortes, Washington, facility, there are seven different U.S. refineries on the block now, accounting for about 5% of U.S. crude oil processing capacity, according to data compiled by Reuters. U.S. energy production is at an all-time record, but there are concerns that refineries that don’t attract buyers could suffer from lack of investment and maintenance that could lead to accidents down the road. These properties, from Washington state to Pennsylvania, are having trouble finding bidders because of unfavorable locales, worries about falling margins, and the coming restart of nearby facilities in the Caribbean that will add to competition, bankers and analysts said.  Just one U.S. refinery transaction closed last year: Chevron Corp’s purchase of a Houston-area plant from Petrobras.  Prior to that, a flurry of corporate mergers saw independent refiners Alon, Western and Tesoro acquired by rivals. The consolidation left some acquirers, like Marathon Petroleum, with limited appetite or ability to consolidate the sector further.  “When some of your really big companies have stopped buying refineries, that really slows things down,” said Matthew Blair, head of refiners equity research at Tudor Pickering Holt \u0026 Co. In addition, new international shipping fuel regulations, known as IMO 2020, and the U.S. renewable fuels standard that requires refineries to blend biofuels into their gasoline pool, have proved a deterrent, as both are seen as potentially detrimental for refining margins.  Last week, Exxon Mobil Corp said fourth-quarter results would decline from the year-earlier period, citing weak margins in refining and chemicals. “Refiners don’t want to get overleveraged if they’re on the downside of the cycle where margins are eroding,” said Matt Flanagan, downstream energy practice partner at Opportune, based in Houston. PBF Energy Inc announced plans to buy a San Francisco-area refinery from Shell in June, but that transaction has still not closed as expected. The company was not immediately available to comment.  CVR Energy Inc, which operates two refineries, said in an October conference call that it failed to find a buyer for the company due to valuation disagreements.  Valuations for refineries vary greatly - Blair suggests Shell’s Anacortes refinery could fetch $500 million to $800 million, putting it significantly below the $1 billion price tag for the Martinez refinery.  East Coast assets have proven particularly tough to unload, as they lack both the scale of U.S. Gulf facilities and access to U.S. crude production. They also face competition from two shuttered Caribbean plants due to restart in coming months that have easier access to overseas crude and more flexible fuel distribution systems.   Philadelphia Energy Solutions put its 335,000-bpd refinery up for sale as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, and is expected to review bids in an auction next week. However, only one bidder has said it plans to revive refinery operations at the site, which shut last year after a fire. Delta Airlines retained bankers to help sell its Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery almost a year ago, but has not found a buyer.  Exxon Mobil’s Billings, Montana, refinery, which has access to local crude and logistics systems, may not sell if a buyer is unwilling to pay a premium for the plant, people familiar with the process said. FILE PHOTO: The Philadelphia Energy Solutions plant refinery is seen in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., August 21, 2019. REUTERS/Mark Makela/File PhotoBeyond market risk, potential buyers must contend with environmental risk due to liability, and the possibility of high-profile disasters like last year’s blaze at Philadelphia Energy Solutions.  “Refiners don’t want to overpay for an asset with environmental liabilities that might require unknown capital expenditure to meet future requirements,” Flanagan said.

    "Title": "China's Geely in talks to take stake in Aston Martin",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - China’s Geely Automobile Holding (0175.HK) is in talks with Aston Martin (AML.L) management and investors about taking a stake in the luxury carmaker, according to a source close to the discussions and a report by the Financial Times, sparking a sharp jump in the British company’s share price. FILE PHOTO: An Aston Martin DB5 is pictured during a promotional appearance on TV in Times Square for the James Bond movie \"No Time to Die\" in New York City, U.S., December 4, 2019. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File PhotoThe Chinese group is conducting due diligence on the 107-year-old UK business, the cars of which are the drive of choice for fictional British secret agent James Bond, the FT reported, citing four people familiar with the discussions. News of Geely’s interest comes a month after Aston Martin confirmed it was in early talks with potential investors as it launched a review of its funding. A stake sale could help to boost Aston’s prospects after it reported a loss in the third quarter and warned this week that 2019 profit would be almost halved from the previous year because of weak European markets.     Geely sees potential savings on technologies and vehicle platforms with integration between between Aston Martin and its own Lotus brand, the source close to the discussions told Reuters. Geely also owns Volvo and a stake in Germany’s Daimler (DAIGn.DE).  An Aston Martin spokesman declined to comment on whether the company is in talks with Geely, saying only that talks with potential investors are ongoing. A spokesman for Geely Europe declined to comment.  Daimler, which owns a 5% stake in Aston Martin and supplies the carmaker with Mercedes-AMG engines, supports efforts by the British carmaker to secure its long-term future, the source said. Daimler declined to comment. Geely Chairman Li Shufu owns a 9.69% stake in Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler, which runs the Smart city car brand with Geely as a joint venture out of China. Shares in Aston Martin jumped as much as 11% after the FT report and closed with a 15% gain at 4.78 pounds ($6.24), well below the 19 pound price of its initial public offering in October 2018. Media reports in December said that Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, owner of Formula One team Racing Point, was preparing a bid for a large stake in Aston Martin.

    "Content": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Online food ordering company Takeaway.com has won the  battle for Britain’s Just Eat with a 6.2 billion pound ($8 billion) share offer that will create one of the world’s largest meal delivery companies. FILE PHOTO: The app for Just Eat is displayed on a smartphone in this posed picture in London, Britain, August 5, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File PhotoTakeaway said that 80.4% of Just Eat shareholders had agreed to its all-share offer, passing a 50% threshold needed to make the offer unconditional. “I am thrilled,” Takeaway CEO and founder Jitse Groen said in a statement. “Just Eat Takeaway.com is a dream combination and I am very much looking forward to leading the company for many years to come.” Takeaway’s bid was worth 906 pence per share at Friday’s close. That trumped a rival 800 pence cash bid from tech investment giant Prosus.  A statement from Prosus CEO Bob van Dijk thanked Just Eat’s board and said his company’s final offer had been “appropriate in light of the investment required” to make Just Eat competitive. “We have been clear throughout that we would remain disciplined in how we allocate our capital and the price that we would offer,” he said. The merged company, which will be led by Takeaway CEO Groen, will have its headquarters in Amsterdam and a listing in London, with 23 subsidiaries mostly in Europe but also in Canada, Australia and Latin America. Takeaway says the combination will handle orders worth more than rivals including GrubHub, Delivery Hero and Uber Eats in a market where China’s Meituan is the largest player by volume. Related CoverageFactbox: Takeaway and Just Eat to form world leading food delivererWORK TO BE DONE While ending a colorful takeover battle, Takeaway’s victory starts the difficult task of integrating Just Eat. As an indication, Takeaway has said the combined company would have had sales of 1.21 billion euros and a loss of 43 million euros on a pro-forma basis in 2018, though both have registered strong sales growth in 2019. Takeaway says the combination will achieve annual cost savings of about 20 million euros from centralizing orders on its platform, unifying brands and improving procurement. Prosus, which has investments in delivery services around the globe, including in Germany-based Delivery Hero, may eventually wind up with a consolation prize. As part of merger plans, Takeaway has said it is likely to sell Just Eat’s 33% stake in iFood, Latin America’s biggest food site, including its strong Brazilian subsidiary. Prosus controls iFood. The fight to buy Just Eat began in August when Takeaway struck a management-backed deal that would give Takeaway a 48% stake in the combined company. That plan was upended when Prosus laid down the first of three unsolicited rival bids in October. All were rejected as inadequate by Just Eat managers.  Prosus argued that Takeaway was underestimating the investment needed to fend off rivals such as Uber Eats and Amazon.com. FILE PHOTO: Signage for Just Eat is seen on the window of a restaurant in London, Britain, August 5, 2019. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File PhotoTakeaway’s Groen responded that food delivery was a low-margin business and his focus was on becoming the dominant ordering platform. The fight reached a dramatic climax on Dec. 19, when Prosus made its final offer and Takeaway responded minutes later with a higher bid, cutting the share of the merged company that will go to its own shareholders to 42.5%. Takeaway will have to prove that the business model it has pursued in Germany and the Netherlands, which has led to rapid sales growth and improved core earnings (EBITDA), will eventually lead to lasting profitability for the group.

    "Title": "Factbox: Takeaway and Just Eat to form world leading food deliverer",
    "Content": "(Reuters) - The takeover by Dutch food delivery company Takeaway.com of its British peer Just Eat is set to create the world’s biggest online food delivery company outside China. Here’s an overview of what the merged company, called Just Eat Takeaway.com NV, will look like: GEOGRAPHY Just Eat Takeaway.com will be active in 23 countries around the globe, covering Europe — from Poland to Portugal and from Norway to Italy — while also catering to Canada, Israel, Australia and New Zealand.  Just Eat or Takeaway is currently the market leader in terms of orders in 15 of these countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. The merged company plans to exit the Latin American market, as it will look to sell Just Eat’s 33% stake in iFood, which runs the leading food delivery platforms in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. FINANCIALS Partnering with over 155,000 restaurants, the companies together processed almost 355 million orders in 2018, with a total value of 7.3 billion euros ($8.1 billion). According to Takeaway’s calculations this beats rivals Uber Eats (6.7 billion euros) and Delivery Hero (4.5 billion euros) and is second only to China’s Meituan (36.2 billion euros). Total revenues of the two companies combined were 1.2 billion euros in 2018. Just Eat generated an operating profit (EBITDA) of 214 million euros in the UK in 2018, while Takeaway made a core profit of 53 millions euros in the Netherlands.  The companies’ other operations ran at a loss, but Takeaway has said it expects the German market to become as profitable as the Dutch over time. The companies expect their merger to ultimately lead to 20 million euros in annual cost savings. MANAGEMENT The new company will be led by Dutchman Jitse Groen, who founded Takeaway.com in 2000 and has remained its Chief Executive Officer throughout the years. Groen currently holds 25% of Takeaway’s shares. Current Just Eat chairman Mike Evans will take on the role of chairman of the supervisory board.  Just Eat Takeaway.com will be headquartered in Amsterdam, and will be listed on the London Stock Exchange.

    "Content": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA’s shopping center business is spending 170 million pounds ($222 million) to buy and upgrade a London mall in its first foray into Britain, betting it can win over a nation increasingly doing its shopping online. FILE PHOTO: The logo of the Swedish furniture giant IKEA is seen before the opening of the company's first store in the heart of Paris, France, May 6, 2019.  REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File PhotoIngka Centers, an arm of the world’s biggest furniture retailer, said on Thursday it would put a new format IKEA store at the heart of the 27,000-square meter Kings Mall in London’s Hammersmith district. It bought the mall from Schroder UK Real Estate Fund.  The move comes as Britain’s store groups struggle, with many outlets closing as shoppers opt to spend more of their money online. “We believe we can upgrade assets in good locations and Kings Mall is a great example of this,” Ingka Centres CEO Gerard Groener said in a statement.  “Modern physical retail needs to be built around local community needs, a complementary mix of uses, digitalisation and sustainability. We simply have to stay relevant to our customers and understand how people want to spend their time,” he said.  The deal marks Ingka Centers’ entry in Britain. It is also its first acquisition of an existing mall, and will be its first anchored by a new-format smaller IKEA store.  The company’s existing 44 shopping centers in 14 markets are all anchored by a traditional, warehouse-like IKEA store, and it has had them built itself.  To meet the growing challenge from online shopping, IKEA is in the midst of rolling out smaller, but more accessible, inner-city stores with more digital and other services.  Urban mixed-use centers for socializing and shopping such as the revamped Kings Mall will support that strategy, Ingka Centers said.

REUTERS/Regis DuvignauPARIS (Reuters) - Concerns among French lawmakers about aerospace firm Latecoere’s (LAEP.PA) sale to a U.S. fund are “overblown”, the head of its major client Dassault Aviation said on Thursday. Dassault (AVMD.PA) boss Eric Trappier was speaking as head of French aerospace industry body GIFAS, after 17 parliamentarians objected to Latecoere’s acquisition by Searchlight Capital, which took a controlling stake last month. Latecoere, based in Toulouse, makes aircraft doors and fuselages and is developing phototronic technologies to deliver on-board internet access with light instead of wifi. Its 2018 sales amounted to 658 million euros ($731 million). “Latecoere is not alone in the market, and it’s not strategic to the point where you could say the sky will fall in if (its) ownership wasn’t French,” the Dassault chief executive said in Paris. “It’s a bit overblown.” Searchlight last year bought a 26% Latecoere stake from funds including Apollo Capital, before increasing the holding to 65.6% in a public offer backed by the French firm and approved under foreign investment vetting procedures. The 17 members of the parliament’s defense and armed forces committee, most from the governing LREM party, had warned in a November letter that the 365 million euro ($406 million) deal raised “questions about the preservation of know-how and France’s defense industry base”, urging government intervention.  Dassault’s Trappier said France and Europe should take a more consistent approach to overseas investment that recognizes their industries’ need for foreign capital. “This goes to the heart of our companies’ attractiveness to capital,” he said. “We do need international funds to invest in our firms - there’s no other solution.” ($1 = 0.8999 euros) Reporting by Laurence Frost;Editing by Elaine HardcastleOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

FILE PHOTO: A general view of Dubai International Financial Centre among high-rise towers in Dubai, United Arab Emirates June 18, 2019.  REUTERS/Christopher Pike/File PhotoAl Jaber, best known as a contractor but with interests across a range of sectors, has struggled since a construction downturn in the United Arab Emirates after the global financial crisis. The auction by First Abu Dhabi Bank, which is the main lender for the Shangri-La hotel, marks a first step by creditors to recover funds after delays to a restructuring agreement for 5.9 billion dirhams of debt last year, one of the sources said. Al Jaber declined to comment when contacted by Reuters on Thursday and FAB was not immediately available for comment. Other creditors will receive distributions from the sale after FAB receives its dues, the sources said. Creditors – which include hedge funds and Abu Dhabi lender Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB.AD) – have started an enforcement process against the group’s shareholders for a loan Al Jaber’s chairman owes to the business, and which creditors have security over, the sources said. ADCB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.One of the sources said the enforcement is expected to formally begin shortly, after two thirds of all the lenders voted for it. Al Jaber began talks with creditors in 2011 after building up debt to expand beyond construction work. As part of the restructuring agreement, Al Jaber was expected to appoint a new board, sell operating companies, some of its investment portfolio and assets such as the Shangri-La hotels in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. In exchange for this, creditors had agreed to extend the maturity of Al Jaber’s 5.9 billion dirhams loan, cut interest rates, and provide additional revolving debt.

    "Content": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, the former head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, on Wednesday lamented the failure of the carmakers to merge with Fiat Chrysler (FCA), which has since combined with Peugeot (PSA). Speaking publicly for the first since his dramatic escape from Japan at the end of 2019, Ghosn told reporters in Beirut that he had been in negotiations with John Elkann, a member of Fiat’s owning family. “In 2017, the alliance was the number one automotive group. Three companies growing, profitable. We were preparing to add Fiat Chrysler to the group because I was negotiating with John Elkann for Fiat Chrysler to join,” he said. “I had contact with FCA. We had a lot of understanding, we have very good dialogue. Unfortunately, I was arrested before we could come to a conclusion,” Ghosn said, adding that a meeting had been scheduled for January 2019 to try to conclude a deal. Renault-Nissan has been in management turmoil ever since Ghosn’s arrest in Tokyo in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies. He was awaiting trial in Japan when he fled to Lebanon. Fiat Chrysler and Renault did announce a $35 billion plan to merge in May 2019, when Ghosn was in detention, but the Italian-American company pulled out only 10 days after the deal was made public. The Renault-Nissan alliance has struggled to move on since the collapse of the deal, which would have created the third biggest carmaker behind Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Toyota. “The alliance missed the unmissable, which is Fiat Chrysler. That is unbelievable, they go with PSA. How can you miss that huge opportunity to become the dominant player in the industry?” Ghosn said. “Who is the winner of all this?” “It’s a great opportunity for PSA, it’s a big waste for Renault,” said Ghosn.

    "Content": "HONG KONG/BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - CITIC Ltd (0267.HK), the main listed arm of Chinese state-owned conglomerate CITIC Group, plans to sell a 22% stake in McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) mainland China and Hong Kong business, which is likely to be bought by the group’s private equity arm.  FILE PHOTO: Customers eat dinner at a McDonald's store in Beijing, China January 9, 2017. REUTERS/Jason LeeThe Hong Kong-listed company aims to raise at least 2.17 billion yuan ($312 million) through the sale, according to a company filing to the China Beijing Equity Exchange on Wednesday.  CITIC Capital, the group’s flagship alternative investment arm which manages over $26 billion in assets, would likely become the buyer, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  The sale is set to be finalised by early February, said one of the people who declined to be named as the information was private.  CITIC Ltd said the transaction is purely a “commercial decision” and it will continue to work for the development of McDonald’s business in China along with its partners. CITIC Capital said it is “actively participating” in the bidding process.  McDonald’s said the transaction would not affect its business strategy and daily operations in mainland China and Hong Kong.  The deal comes months after CITIC Capital raised $2.8 billion in its fourth China buyout fund, the firm’s biggest private equity fund to date, bolstering its ability to cut deals in the world’s second-largest economy. CITIC Ltd is selling the 22% stake via Fast Food Holdings Ltd, a holding firm that it set up with CITIC Capital for the combined controlling stake of 52% in McDonald’s China and Hong Kong business.  McDonald’s Corp in early 2017 agreed to sell 80% of such business to CITIC Ltd (0267.HK), CITIC Capital and Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) for $2.08 billion, saying at the time that they hoped tying up with local partners could speed up growth in China. CITIC Ltd held 32% of the business, with CITIC Capital and Carlyle holding 20% and 28%, respectively. McDonald’s retained the remaining 20%, the companies said in a statement at the time. After the stake sale, CITIC Ltd will retain 10% of the business.  In late 2017, the U.S. fast food giant changed its registered business name reut.rs/37VX7rB to \"Golden Arches (China) Co Ltd\" in China and planned to nearly double the number of its outlets in mainland China to 4,500 by 2022.

    "Content": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German battery maker Varta (VAR1.DE) said on Wednesday that it has warned electronic goods traders after finding products with batteries from Chinese manufacturers which infringe on its patents.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/IllustrationThe company’s shares plunged 20% after the issue was flagged by a note from analysts at Commerzbank, which downgraded their recommendation for the stock to Hold from Buy.  “If they do not react immediately after the deadline, we will seek preliminary injunctions,” a Varta spokeswoman said, adding that Varta learned of the situation only in December. Some stock traders also linked Varta’s share price collapse to lithium producer Livent (LTHM.N) cutting its earnings outlook on Tuesday due to a downturn in prices of the battery metal. Commerzbank cited a report of an active shortseller, which  uncovered that Chinese companies have successfully broken into several of Varta’s key accounts such as Samsung (005930.KS), Jabra, Sony (6758.T) and JBL.  “The Chinese second sources seem to have arisen as the market demand was too strong for Varta to satisfy and its earbud clients seem to have been afraid to lose market share with supply from Varta only”, the brokerage said.  Varta was taking legal steps against the alleged infringement by Chinese producers EVE Energy Company and MIC-Power, it added. The shortseller, dubbed “Black Mamba”, additionally named battery firms ZeniPower and Great Power as suppliers which are encroaching on Varta’s near-monopoly in supplying batteries for so-called truly wireless stereo (TWS) earphones, one of its core businesses. “Without a monopoly on the premium TWS market, we believe that the market’s expectations of the value of Varta’s entertainment business are far too rosy”, the shortseller said. Short selling involves borrowing an asset and selling it with the aim of buying it back at a cheaper price and making a profit. The Chinese firms had no immediate comment.
